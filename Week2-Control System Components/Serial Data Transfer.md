• Frame is the smallest packet of bits that can be transmitted. e.g., the RS-232
frame shown below has one start bit, seven/eight data bits, no/even/odd
parity, and one/1.5/two stop bits (RS-232 is a communication standard).

• Parity is generated by transmitter and checked by receiver to detect errors.
• The start bit is used to synchronize the receiver with the transmitter.
• The bit time is the time that a single data bit is valid during transfer. The
transmitter outputs a bit, waits one bit time, and then outputs the next bit.
• The number of signal changes per second on a communication channel is
its baud rate. Since pure binary signals can only change between one of
two possible values, their baud rate is equivalent to the number of bits per
second (bps) transferred. => Baud rate = 1/(bit time)
