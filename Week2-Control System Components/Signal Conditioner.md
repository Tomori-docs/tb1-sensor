• A signal conditioning
circuit brings a signal from
the sensing element up to
the format that is
compatible with the load
device (typically an ADC).
• The signal conditioner
depends on the type of the
sensor.
• The table lists five types of
sensors, their equivalent
impedance, and the
suitable signal conditioner.
