Fig 7. Microcontroller overview.

 
 CPU (a microprocessor) is the ‘computer’ part of
the microcontroller, e.g., basic 8085 microprocessor
core in Intel 8051 microcontroller.
• On-chip memory units.
• I/O devices, or “computer peripherals," provide the
path for parallel (word/byte via parallel I/O) or serial
(bit at a time via UART (Universal Asynchronous
Receiver/Transmitter)) communication between the
computer system and the “real world.”
• Clock oscillator to control the time for executing an instruction.
• Timer unit to time/count events.
• A/D converters to convert analogue signal to digital formats.
• Digital-to-analogue converter (D/A or DAC) that are mostly pulse-width modulators
(PWMs) along with a suitable external RC filter.
• ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming) to program and in-circuit debug to debug the
microcontroller.
