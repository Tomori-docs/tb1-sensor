• A signal conditioning circuit brings a signal from the sensing element up to
the format that is compatible with the load device (typically an ADC). This
may include amplification, filtering, and impedance matching.
• 𝜇C components include a microprocessor, on-chip memory units, I/O devices
like UART and timers, clock oscillator, ADC, DAC, and in-circuit debug.
• Serial communication could be simplex, half duplex, or full duplex.
• In asynchronous data transfer, the transmitter and receiver do not share a
common clock signal, whereas, in synchronous transfer, there is a common
clock signal between the transmitter and receiver.
• Communication protocols: UART, SPI, I2C, CAN, USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and
Bluetooth
