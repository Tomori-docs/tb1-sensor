Pressure sensors like thin silicon diaphragm as a
movable plate of the variable-gate capacitor
(asymmetrical structure) or an accelerometer
(symmetrical structure) are two examples.

• These capacitances are usually in the order of several pF, therefore, extremely
susceptible to parasitic capacitances in the order of 1 pF. C/V conversion is a suitable
method to overcome this barrier.
