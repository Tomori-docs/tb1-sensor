A car door monitoring arrangement to detect open doors.
• Every door is connected to a sensor (usually an electric switch) that detects
the door position (open (zero) or closed (one)).
• Signals from doors are sent to the car internal processor (no need for ADC).
• The processor triggers the display and an alarm if the signal is zero.
• The driver (actuator) close the door, and the sensor outputs the signal ‘one’.
