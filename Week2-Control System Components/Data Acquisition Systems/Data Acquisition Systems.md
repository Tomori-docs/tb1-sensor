• An object can be anything: A car, a
spaceship, a human, an animal, etc.

• Data are collected from an object by few
sensors:
  ➢ Sensors 1 and 5 are not in physical contact
  with the object (e.g., a radiation detector).
  Handbook of modern sensors: Physics, designs, and applications.
  
  ➢ Sensors 1 and 3 cannot be directly connected to standard circuits due to their
  inappropriate output signals (e.g., a strain gauge), so, they require an interface
  circuit (signal conditioner).
  
  ➢ Sensors 1, 2, 3, and 5 are passive (i.e., don’t require external power source. e.g.,
  thermocouple) and sensor 4 is active (e.g., a temperature sensitive resistor).
  
  ➢ Sensors are fed into a multiplexer (MUX). A MUX transfer the sensors' data one
  at a time to an analogue-to-digital converter (A/D or ADC). A/D is required if the sensor produces an analogue signal.
