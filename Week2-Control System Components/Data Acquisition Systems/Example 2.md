An anaesthetic vapor delivery system to control the level of anaesthetic drugs delivered
to a patient through inhalation during surgical procedure.
• The vapor concentration of anaesthetic agents is monitored by an active
piezoelectric sensor installed into a ventilation tube. Molecules of the anaesthetic
vapours modify the mass absorbed onto the sensor that results in the shift in its
natural resonating frequency.
• Several other sensors measure CO2 concentration to distinguish exhale from inhale,
temperature and pressure to compensate for additional variables.
• All sensors’ data are multiplexed, digitized, and fed into a digital signal processor
(DSP) which calculates the actual vapor concentration.
• The anaesthesiologist sets the desired drug delivery level, and the processor adjust
actuators (valves) to maintain drugs at the correct concentration.
