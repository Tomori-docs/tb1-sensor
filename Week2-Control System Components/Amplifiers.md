• Many sensors produce weak output signals (voltages in the order of μV and currents
in the order of pA). Therefore, an amplification is required as part of the conditioning.
• Nowadays, amplifiers composed of standard building blocks named operational
amplifier (OP-AMPS).
• An amplifier not only amplifies but also does the impedance matching, enhances
signal-to-noise ratio, acts as a frequency filter and an insulator between the sensor
and the rest of circuit.
