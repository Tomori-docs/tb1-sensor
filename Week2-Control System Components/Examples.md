Fig 10. Power supply distribution in a
desktop computer.

• An electromagnetic interference (EMI)
filter to avoid EMI generating current in
the line.
• AC to 200 V DC conversion using a
rectifier and a power factor correction
circuit (PFC). The PFC improves the
harmonic distortion and power factor of
the current drawn from the AC source.
• An LLC converter to reduce 200 V to 12
V. An LLC converter is a resonant
converter including two inductors and
one capacitor.
• A few step-down converters.

distribution in a car.

A few step-down and
step-up converters to
match the voltage
requirements for
sensors, switches,
CAN (car area
network), and LVDS
(Low voltage
differential signalling).

Fig 12. PMU components for energy
harvesting-based systems.

• A power converter to convert the energy
from one form to another. For example,
the AC–DC converter (rectifier) is
utilized in devices powered by vibration
or RF.
• The power converter implements control
circuits to extract the maximum power
point and stores it in a storage element
either a battery or a super-capacitor.
• A voltage regulator is employed to
support a regulated output voltage.
• A start-up circuit to start and power up
the whole device at the beginning
