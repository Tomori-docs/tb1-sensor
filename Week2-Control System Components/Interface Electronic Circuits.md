• The sensors are usually integrated with signal conditioning, converting, and
communication circuits. That is named as a sensing module

• Signal conditioning is important since the sensor’s output signal might be too weak,
too noisy, or includes undesirable components. Therefore, usually the signals require
amplification, filtering, impedance matching and perhaps level-shifting before
digitisation.
• Some sensors only generate analogue outputs. For inputting sensor’s output signal to
a processor, the signal should be in a digital format.
• The processed information should be communicated in a selected format to the
outside peripheral devices.
