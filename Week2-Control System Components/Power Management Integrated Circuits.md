• All electronic components require a stable DC power supply for their operation. The
supply voltage for these components is determined mainly by:
➢ Maximum operating voltage based on their reliability limit: For example, the
maximum voltage applied across a transistor’s terminals is limited by factors such
as gate-oxide thickness and oxide breakdown limit. The maximum voltage is also
limited to reduce the system’s overall power consumption.
➢ Minimum voltage based on the performance: For example, a processor or memory
requires a minimum supply voltage to ensure operation at its optimum frequency.
• The primary sources of energy for most electronic systems are batteries, solar cells,
thermal, vibration, and RF energies, and grid power. Direct application of output
voltage from these sources does not meet the systems’ requirements.
• e.g., the output voltage of a Li+ cell can vary between 2.7 V and 4.2 V depending on
its available charge. A typical processor chip requires a supply voltage of about 1 V
DC to operate at optimum performance, and so the battery voltage must be stepped
down and regulated within a range of 0.8-1.2 V.
