▪ Adaptive Sampling: Adjusts the frequency of data collection based on
environmental conditions or application needs
▪ Compression Techniques: Reduces the amount of data transmitted by
compressing sensor data before transmission.
▪ Duty Cycling: Alternates between active and sleep modes to reduce energy
consumption during idle periods
▪ Low-Power Communication Protocols: Uses energy-efficient
communication protocols to minimise power use during data transmission
▪ Efficient Algorithms: Implements algorithms that minimize computational
complexity and energy consumption
▪ Edge Computing: Processes data locally on the sensor node to reduce the
amount of data transmitted and save energy
