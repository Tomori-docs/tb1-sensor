▪ Batteries:
– Pros: high energy density
– Cons: limited cycle life, temperature sensitivity, and cost
▪ (Super-)Capacitors:
– Pros: high power density, greater cycle life and quicker charge/discharge
rates
– Cons: more expensive and lower energy density
▪ Hybrid Systems:
– Pros: maximise the benefits of both technologies
– Cons: need to balance complexity and cost
