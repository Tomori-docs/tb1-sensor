▪ Energy-Efficient Routing Protocols
– Optimize the path for data transmission to minimize energy consumption.
➢ Energy-efficient variants of routing protocols like LEACH (LowEnergy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) and TEEN (Thresholdsensitive Energy-Efficient Network)
▪ Energy Harvesting Aware Protocols
– Incorporate energy-harvesting capabilities into routing and data
management strategies.
➢ Protocols that adjust energy consumption based on the availability
of harvested energy.
▪ Load Balancing Protocols
– Distribute energy consumption evenly across the network to prevent early
depletion of energy in specific nodes.
➢ Load-balancing mechanisms that dynamically adjust node roles
based on energy levels
