▪ Level 1 includes physical devices and controllers that might
control multiple devices. These are the “things” in the IoT, and
they include a wide range of endpoint devices that send and
receive information
▪ Communications and connectivity are concentrated in Level 2.
The most important function of Level 2 is reliable, timely
information transmission. To do so, several technologies can be
used, like Bluetooth, WiFi, cellular, etc.
▪ In Level 3, data is (pre)processed in some way so it is suitable for
storage and higher-level processing at the next level
▪ Layers 4 and 5 deal with data storage and processing,
respectively. Due to the vast amount of data generated, special
data storage (Big Data) and analysis technologies and techniques
(e.g., ML) need to be considered
▪ Level 6 is the application level, where information is interpretated
▪ In Level 7, the information created by the IoT system is
transformed into action through processes and people. Cloud
Computing solutions can enable the management and control of
the processes at the latest layers of the IoT architecture
