▪ Approach 1: The energy harvesters will firstly charge the
energy storage unit (e.g., a supercapacitor), which will keep
powering all the functional units in this system, including
sensors, processors, and wireless data transmission modules
▪ Approach 2: The system is mainly in the sleep mode, so
energy harvesters can keep collecting energy and storing it in
the energy storage unit, while the switch keeps open and does
not power other units. Only when specific events happen,
which exceed a certain threshold and let the event-based
switch become close, the functional units will be powered and
send out the critical obtained sensing data
▪ Approach 3: It is based on the direct wireless transmission of
the voltage signals generated by self-powered sensors.
Through inductive coupling, the sensing output can be directly
sent out without the requirement of energy harvesters, energy
storage units, and wireless modules
