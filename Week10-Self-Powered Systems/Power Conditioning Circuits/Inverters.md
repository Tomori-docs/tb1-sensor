▪ They convert power in DC form to AC form at the
required frequency and voltage output
▪ They use high-speed switches (IGBT, MOSFET)
that open and close rapidly to produce AC power
▪ Two main categories:
– Voltage Source Inverter (VSI)
➢ Powered by a DC voltage source
➢ There is usually a shunt capacitor with
large capacitance to smooth out the DC
input voltage
– Current Source Inverter (CSI)
➢ Powered by a DC current source
➢ DC current source is normally obtained
by using a large series inductor
powered by a DC voltage source
