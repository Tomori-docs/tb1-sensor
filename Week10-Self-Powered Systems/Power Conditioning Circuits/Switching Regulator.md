▪ A switching element switches on/off to turn an input voltage
into a pulse wave, which is smoothed out to create an output
voltage, whose value depends on the on/off ratio
▪ Types:
– Step-down (or buck) switching regulator: It produces
an output voltage lower than an input voltage
– Step-up (boost) switching regulator: An inductor
placed on the input stores energy when the switching
element is on and releases energy when the same is
off, creating an output voltage higher than the input
– Step-down/step-up (buck-boost) switching
regulator: A power circuit capable of both step-down
and step-up actions. It is used in applications where an
input voltage fluctuates significantly
