▪ It continuously checks the supply's condition and adjusts to avoid potentially harmful or dangerous situations.
▪ Overcharge Protection
– To stop the supply/system from being charged above its maximum voltage.
– It either stop or redirect the charging current when the voltage hits a predetermined threshold
▪ Over-Discharge Protection
– To stop the supply/system discharging below a specified voltage threshold
– It either disconnects the load or implements measures to prohibit further discharging
▪ Short Circuit Protection
– To shield both the battery and the associated circuitry in the occurrence of a short circuit event.
– A short circuit triggers an exorbitant surge in current flow, generating heat and escalating the risk of fire/explosion
– It deploys fast-acting fuses or circuit breakers that disconnect the supply/system
▪ Thermal Protection
– It continually monitors the supply’s/system’s temperature and intervene when the temperature exceeds the safe
limits, e.g., initiating cooling measures when too hot
