## ⚡ Transformers ⚡


* They **change the level of alternating voltage or current** without changing in the frequency of the supply.
* A transformer has a **primary coil** to which input is given and a **secondary coil** from which the output is collected. Both coils are wound on a core material, an insulator.
* Operation based on the principle of **mutual inductance**: a changing current in one coil of wire induces a voltage in a second, nearby coil through a shared magnetic field.

### Key Variables

* $N_p$ : Number of turns in the primary winding
* $N_s$ : Number of turns in the secondary winding
* $I_p$ : Primary current
* $I_s$ : Secondary current
* $V_p$ : Primary voltage
* $V_s$ : Secondary voltage

### Turns Ratio

**Turns ratio or ratio of transformation $N$**: Ratio of number of turns in the primary coil to the number of turns in the secondary coil.

$$
\frac{N_p}{N_s} = \frac{V_p}{V_s} = N = \text{Turns ratio}
$$

### AC Conversion

The diagram illustrates the process:
