▪ A semiconductor diode conducts current in one
direction when forward biased, and blocks current
in their reverse direction when reverse biased
▪ Two semiconductor layers (P-N) with one PN
junction and two terminals: anode and cathode.
▪ Once the voltage across the diode exceeds a
threshold (0.7V for silicon), it begins to conduct
unless the voltage reverses
▪ Can be used individually or connected together to
produce a variety of rectifier circuits such as “HalfWave”, “Full-Wave” or as “Bridge Rectifiers”
▪ Smoothing capacitors to smooth ripples
▪ Many types: Thyristors, Schottky, etc.
