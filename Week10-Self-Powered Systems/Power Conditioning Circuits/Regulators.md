## ⚡ Linear Regulator vs. Switching Regulator Comparison

| Item | Linear Regulator | Switching Regulator |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Circuits to be driven** | Amplifier circuits, high-frequency circuits, small current circuits, cost-cut-oriented circuits, etc. | Processors, memories, graphic chips, network controllers, LCs, organic ELs, etc. |
| **Voltage conversion** | Step-down only ❌ | Step-down, step-up, step-up/step-down (polarity reversal, no polarity reversal) ✅ |
| **Output current** | About several hundreds of mA to 1 A in many cases ❌ | It can be configured as a circuit capable of outputting a current of 100 A or larger, depending on an external power device attached thereto. ✅ |
| **Energy efficiency** | Energy efficiency drops when there is a significant difference between the input voltage and the output voltage. ❌ | Approximately 80% to 90% (98% at maximum) ✅ |
| **Noise** | Hardly generates. ✅ | Inevitably generates due to its operation principle. ❌ |
| **Design-related difficulty (technical difficulty)** | Low ✅ | Relatively high (in the case of a single chip module, etc.) ❌ |
| **Cost** | Low ✅ | High ❌ |
