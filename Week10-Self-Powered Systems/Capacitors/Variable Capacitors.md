▪ Capacitance is usually changed by changing the area of opposing electrodes. Types:
– Tuning capacitors, which can be frequently changed (e.g., radio tuning)
– Trimmer capacitors, which are changed only once for adjustment (e.g., during circuit assembly) usually for
calibration
▪ Capacitance is changed with a knob or a driver. Its mechanically-based tunning mechanism makes it difficult to produce
capacitors with a large capacitance.
