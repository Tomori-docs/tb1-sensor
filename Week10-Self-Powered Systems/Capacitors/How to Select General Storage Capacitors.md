# How to Select General Storage Capacitors

---

## Step 1: Electrical characteristics and physical size

* **Important parameters:** capacitance, rated voltage, ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance), etc.
* For low performance/low current devices, **general electrolytic may suffice**.
* For high-current, high-frequency, high-performance circuits, **low ESR is crucial** $\rightarrow$ **conductive polymer is preferred**.

## Step 2: Reliability and cost

* Consider the application needs and environment.
* **General electrolytic capacitors:** Lowest cost when spec is modest. But risk: **leakage, "dry-up" over time**, especially under stress (temperature, vibration).
* **Conductive polymer capacitors:** More stable over temperature, voltage, and aging. **Better for long-life or mission-critical applications** (automotive, IoT, edge devices).
