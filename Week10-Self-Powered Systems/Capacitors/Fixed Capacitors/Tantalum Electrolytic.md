▪ On the surface of sintered tantalum metal powder (anode) tantalum
pentoxide is formed as a dielectric, and manganese dioxide (solid) is
used as electrolyte
▪ Advantages
– Smaller than aluminum electrolytic capacitors
– Excellent frequency characteristics
– Long life (solid electrolyte)
▪ Disadvantages
– Costlier than Aluminum Electrolytic capacitors, due to tantalum’s
restricted availability
– Risk of ignition due to potential short-circuit failure
