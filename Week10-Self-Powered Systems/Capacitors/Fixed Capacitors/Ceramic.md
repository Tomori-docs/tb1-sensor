▪ Most used capacitors. They use ceramic with a high permittivity as their
dielectric
▪ Advantages
– Non polar
– Excellent high frequency characteristics (low ESR)
– High heat resistance
– Long life
– Thin-film multilayer structures allow for miniaturised and large
capacitance versions (usually from 1F to 100F)
▪ Disadvantages
– DC bias characteristics (significant change in capacitance depending on
the applied voltage)
– Squealing (noise due to high frequency vibration)
– cracks can occur due to temperature or mechanical impact
