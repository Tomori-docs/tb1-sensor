▪ Fixed capacitors are broadly classified into:
– Nonpolar capacitors have no restrictions on the
polarity of the voltage applied to their terminals
(i.e., either terminal can be positive), so they can
be directly used in AC.
➢ Examples: Ceramic, film, mica, paper, and air
capacitors
– Polar capacitors have specific positive and
negative polarities and must be used with a DC
voltage or a voltage that varies only on the positive
side. However, polar capacitors can provide small
and large capacity capacitors
➢ Examples: Aluminum electrolytic capacitors,
tantalum electrolytic capacitors, conductive
polymer (electrolytic) capacitors, and electric
double layer capacitors
