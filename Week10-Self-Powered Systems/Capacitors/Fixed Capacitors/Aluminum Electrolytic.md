▪ An aluminum oxide film (dielectric) is formed on the surface of the
aluminum foil of the anode, and electrolyte liquid (a solvent in which
electrolyte is dissolved) is used as an electrolyte (cathode)
▪ Advantages
– Large capacity due to its high permittivity dielectric layer (Tantalum
has high capacitance per volume and lower weight)
– Low impedance values even at mains frequency
– Mostly used in Power supply circuits, SMPS, Switched Mode
Power Supply and DC-DC Converters
▪ Disadvantages
– Higher equivalent series resistance (ESR) compared to ceramic
and film capacitors
– Limited life: The electrolyte liquid vaporises depending on the
temperature, and capacity decreases and ESR rises over time,
eventually leading it to be in an open state (electrolyte liquid
having dried up)
