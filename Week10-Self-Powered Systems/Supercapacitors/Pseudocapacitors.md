▪ They follow the electrochemical process for the
deposition of charge, the faradaic process:
– At an electrode, when some chemical substance
reduces or oxidizes, some current is generated.
– During such process, these capacitors store the
electric charge by electron transfer between
electrode and electrolyte.
▪ Advantages:
– They get charged much faster and store the
charge as much as a battery does
– They are operated at a faster rate
– These can be used in tandem with batteries to
improve life
