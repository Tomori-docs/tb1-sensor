▪ They are electrostatic capacitors. Charge deposition
follows the principle of (Helmholtz) Double-layer.
▪ Instead of a dielectric, electric double layer capacitors
(EDLCs) use an electric double layer formed at the
interface between the electrode and electrolyte liquid as
a dielectric function.
▪ The charge and discharge process of EDLCs uses ionic
adsorption and desorption on the surface of activated
carbon electrodes, which are used as positive and
negative electrodes.
