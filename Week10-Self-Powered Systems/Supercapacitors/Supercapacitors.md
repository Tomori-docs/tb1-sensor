## 🔋 Supercapacitors

* **A supercapacitor (or ultracapacitor) is a high-capacity capacitor that bridges the gap between electrolytic capacitors and rechargeable batteries:**
    * Stores **10-100 times more energy** per unit mass/volume than electrolytic capacitors
    * Accepts and delivers charge **faster than batteries**
    * Tolerates **more charge and discharge cycles** than rechargeable batteries
* Unlike ordinary capacitors using a solid dielectric, supercapacitors use **electrostatic double-layer capacitance** and/or **electrochemical pseudocapacitance**, which contribute to its total energy storage.
* The supercapacitor's total energy\* $E$ is the difference between the energy stored at the charging voltage $V_1$ and the energy at the cut-off voltage $V_2$
    $$E = \frac{1}{2} C (V_1^2 - V_2^2)$$
> \*also called usable energy
