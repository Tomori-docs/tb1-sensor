▪ Combination of EDLC and Pseudo Capacitors, where
activated carbon is used as cathode and the pre-doped
carbon material acts as anode
▪ Example: Li ion capacitor
▪ Advantages
– High tolerance in a wide range of temperature
variations from -55C to 200C
– Highly reliable and compact
– Rugged, they can tolerate extreme shock, vibration
and pressure from environment
➢ Used in airborne applications
▪ Disadvantages
– High cost
