- Photodiode: Typically operates under reverse bias. Its output signal is an electric current, which is directly proportional to the measured light intensity. Therefore, a Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA) is required to convert the current signal into a voltage signal.
光电二极管 (Photodiode)：通常在反向偏压下工作，其输出信号是电流，与被测光强成正比。因此，需要电流-电压转换放大器 (Transimpedance Amplifier) 将其转换为电压信号。


- Piezoelectric Sensor: Its output signal is an electric charge, which is generated by mechanical stress. Therefore, a Charge Amplifier is required to convert the charge signal into a voltage signal.压电传感器 (Piezoelectric Sensor)：其输出信号是电荷，由机械应力产生。因此，需要电荷-电压转换放大器 (Charge Amplifier) 将其转换为电压信号。

- Since there are two sensors, the system requires a Multiplexer (MUX) to time-divisionally select the signals from different channels before feeding them into a shared Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) for digitization.由于有两个传感器，系统需要一个多路复用器 (MUX) 来分时选择不同通道的信号，然后送入一个共用的模数转换器 (ADC) 进行数字化。
