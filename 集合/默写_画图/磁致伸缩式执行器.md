Magnetostrictive (磁致伸缩式)	Current in coil -> Mechanical elongation (线圈中的电流 -> 机械伸长)
![](/file/2/3kodEwUBDLhVbiQ3j1FaP.png)

✨ Principle: Based on the Joule Magnetostriction Effect, where a ferromagnetic material changes shape when subjected to a magnetic field (produced by the coil current).


✨ 原理: 基于焦耳磁致伸缩效应，铁磁材料在外加磁场（由线圈电流产生）作用下发生形变。

### Question 4: What each highlighted element in the equivalent circuit (Fig. 5) for the magnetorestrictive actuator reparents?

1. Inductor
Represents the electrical domain of the actuator.
2. Transducer
Represents the electromechanical coupling or transduction effect, which is the core of the magnetostrictive principle.
3. Capacitor
Represents the mechanical domain of the actuator. This is the mechanical compliance (inverse of stiffness) of the actuator's structure.
