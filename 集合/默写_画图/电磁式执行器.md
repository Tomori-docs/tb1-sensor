Electromagnetic (电磁式)	Current in coil -> Mechanical movement (线圈中的电流 -> 机械运动)
![](/file/2/LKcIloj20ejoQe-2RS4IM.png)

✨ Principle: A coil current produces a magnetic field that interacts with a permanent magnet, causing movement (Lorentz force).


✨ 原理: 利用通电线圈产生的磁场与永磁体相互作用产生洛伦兹力，实现运动。

1. Transducer
Represents the component that converts energy between the electrical domain (voltage $V$) and the mechanical domain (force $F$, velocity $v$).

2. Capacitor $L_0$
an inductor ($L_0$) represents mechanical compliance. $L_0$ is the initial/static mechanical compliance.

3. Transformer
Represents the strength of the coupling between the electrical and mechanical domains.

4. Parallel Plate Capacitor $k^*$
This element represents the stiffness of the mechanical side after considering the softening effect of the electrostatic force.
