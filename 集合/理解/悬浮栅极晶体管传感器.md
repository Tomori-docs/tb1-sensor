A movable-gate field effect transistor is fabricated, where the suspended gate is moving laterally above the channel. 

Explain how this structure can be used as a displacement sensor.(位移传感器)


A:
* By lateral movement of the suspended gate over the channel, the width of the channel ($W$) covered by the gate is changing that will result in changes in the current of the transistor ($I_D$): $I_D \propto W$.

通过悬浮栅极在沟道上方的横向移动，栅极所覆盖的沟道宽度 ($W$) 发生变化，这将导致晶体管电流 ($I_D$) 的变化： $I_D \propto W$。
