▪ Battery technologies power sensing and actuation
systems by providing portable, reliable energy.
▪ A battery is a device that converts chemical energy into
electrical energy and vice versa.
▪ It consists of one or more cells, the basic units of
electrochemical reactions.
▪ Each cell has a positive electrode (cathode), a negative
electrode (anode), and an electrolyte that allows the
flow of ions between them.
▪ When a battery is connected to a load, electrons flow
from the anode to the cathode through the external
circuit, providing electrical power.
