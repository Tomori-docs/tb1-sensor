▪ Popular for applications requiring high energy density,
such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles.
▪ Similar to Li-ion batteries, where the cathode is made of
Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2
)
▪ Advantages:
➢ High energy density
➢ LiCoO2 has a layered structure that is easy to
synthesise and handle, making it a popular choice for
commercial applications
▪ Disadvantages:
➢ Co is scarce and expensive, which can limit production
➢ Relatively short lifespan
➢ Safety issues, as it can suffer from thermal instability
➢ Low specific power, which can limit its ability to deliver
high power output
