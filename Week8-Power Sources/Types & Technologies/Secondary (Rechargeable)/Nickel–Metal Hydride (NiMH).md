▪ Commonly used for consumer electronics, power tools,
and hybrid electric vehicles.
▪ Comprised by a positive electrode made of nickel
hydroxide (Ni(OH)2
), and a metal alloy (negative
electrode) capable of forming hydrides.
▪ Discharging operation: the nickel hydroxide at
the cathode oxidises to nickel oxyhydroxide and
releases electrons. The metal alloy at the anode
reacts with hydroxide ions to form a metal hydride.
▪ Charging operation: these reactions reverse.
▪ Advantages:
➢ Higher energy density, a lower “memory effect” (wherein
batteries lose capacity if not fully discharged).
➢ Reliability, size versatility, and relatively low cost.
▪ Disadvantages:
➢ Higher self-discharge rate and lower energy density
than contemporary lithium–ion batteries.
