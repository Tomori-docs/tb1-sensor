▪ Popular for E-bikes, medical devices, EVs, industrial
applications due to high capacity and high power
▪ Cathode is a combination of nickel, manganese, and
cobalt (LiNiMn2O4
)
▪ Advantages:
➢ High energy density and good stability
➢ Lower cost compared to other cathode materials,
making it an option for large-scale battery production
▪ Disadvantages:
➢ Poor thermal stability, leading to a higher risk of thermal
runaway, fire, or explosion, especially at high
temperatures or during damage
