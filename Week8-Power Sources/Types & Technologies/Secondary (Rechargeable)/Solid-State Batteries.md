▪ LiPos were designed to eliminate liquid electrolytes and
minimise the risk of leakage and safety hazards
▪ LiPos packaged in an aluminum foil “pouch” and are
called soft or pouch cells.
▪ Cheaper and easier to fabricate, enabling the production
of batteries with varied, custom configurations
▪ Advantages:
➢ More flexible and lightweight than Li–ion batteries
➢ Disadvantages:
➢ Same challenges that Li-ion batteries, such as
overcharging, over-discharging
