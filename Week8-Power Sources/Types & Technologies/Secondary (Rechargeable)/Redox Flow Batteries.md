▪ Primarily used in grid energy storage due to their ability
to store vast amounts of energy for long periods
▪ Ideal choice for remote applications requiring consistent
power supply, such as IoT sensor networks monitoring
environmental parameters or infrastructure over
extended areas
▪ Separated by a membrane, two liquid electrolyte
solutions are stored in external tanks and pumped
through a cell stack to undergo redox reactions,
releasing electrons and generating electricity
▪ Advantages:
➢ Highly scalable and customizable: Their energy capacity
is determined by the size of the electrolyte tanks, the
size and design of the cell stack determine the power
output, i.e., how quickly energy can be delivered
➢ Disadvantages:
➢ Difficult to miniaturise
