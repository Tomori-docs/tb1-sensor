▪ Extensively used in the automotive industry
▪ Comprised by a lead dioxide (PbO2
) positive plate and a
lead (Pb) negative plate, immersed in an electrolyte
solution of sulphuric acid and water
▪ Discharging process: both plates react with
sulphuric acid to produce lead sulphate (PbSO4
)
and water. This reaction releases electrons,
providing electrical power.
▪ Charging process: lead sulphate and water are
converted back into PbO2
, Pb, and sulphuric acid.
▪ Disadvantages:
➢ Sulphation: formation of larger, less reversible lead
sulphate crystals when the battery remains discharged
for a long time
➢ Low energy density
▪ Advantages:
➢ Cost-effectiveness and reliability
