▪ Popular for medical devices, power tools, electric
powertrains, etc. due to improved safety
▪ Cathode is made of Lithium manganese oxide
(LiMn2O4
) with a three-dimensional spinel structure
▪ Advantages:
➢ The spinel structure allows for high thermal stability and
improves ion flow on the electrode
➢ They can produce the same voltage as cobalt lithium–
ion batteries and can be made at a low cost
▪ Disadvantages:
➢ During charging and discharging, manganese may
dissolve out into the electrolyte, shortening battery life
