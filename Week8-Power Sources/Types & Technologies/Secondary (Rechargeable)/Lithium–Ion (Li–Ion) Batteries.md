▪ Construction
▪ The cathode (positive electrode) is metal oxide and the
anode (negative electrode) consists of porous carbon.
▪ The electrolyte, a conductor liquid, allow the ions to be
transported between the electrodes.
▪ A separator layer is present between both electrodes,
which enables ion transport while preventing electrical
contact between the electrodes. The separator, usually
made of synthetic resins like polyethylene (PE) and
polypropylene (PP), determine the safety of the battery
▪ Usually delivered in a stainless steel or aluminum case,
which can be cylindrical, button-shaped or rectangular
(prismatic).
▪ The case is relatively costly to produce and tends to
restrict the sizes and shapes that are available. But it is
also robust, helping to protect the battery from damage.
