▪ Popular for applications where frequent charging and
discharging is required
▪ Cathode is a combination of uses lithium iron phosphate
(LiFePO4
) with olivine structure for easy migration of
lithium ions during the electrochemical processes
▪ Advantages:
➢ Higher cycle life and environmentally friendlier than
other Li–ion batteries due to the absence of heavy
metals like Co and Ni
➢ Very good thermal stability and reduced risk of thermal
runaway, making them one of the safest Li–ion
chemistries available
▪ Disadvantages:
➢ Lower power densities compared to other lithium–ion
chemistries
