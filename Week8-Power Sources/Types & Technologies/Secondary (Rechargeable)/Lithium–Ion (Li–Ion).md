▪ Wide range of applications, from portable electronics to
electric vehicles.
▪ Comprised by a cathode composed of lithium metal
oxide, an anode made from graphite, and an electrolyte
that contains lithium ions.
▪ Discharging operation: the lithium ions move
from the anode to the cathode through the
electrolyte, while electrons flow through the
external circuit, providing power to the device.
▪ Charging operation: these reactions reverse.
▪ Advantages:
➢ High number of charge and discharge cycles, as they
generate electricity without dissolving the electrodes in
the electrolyte
▪ Disadvantages:
➢ More expensive than other types of batteries and pose
a fire hazard due to malfunction and overcharging.
