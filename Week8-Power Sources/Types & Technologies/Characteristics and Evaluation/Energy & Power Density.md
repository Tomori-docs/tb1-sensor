▪ Energy density is a measure of how much energy a
battery can store per unit volume or mass. Types:
➢ Gravimetric energy density (or specific energy):
amount of energy stored per battery’s unit mass.
Measured in watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg).
➢ Volumetric energy density measures how much
energy a battery can store per unit volume,
commonly expressed in watt-hours per litre (Wh/L).
▪ Power density refers to the rate at which stored energy
can be delivered.
➢ Gravimetric power density is measured in watts
per kilogram (W/kg), while volumetric power
density is measured in watts per litre (W/L)
