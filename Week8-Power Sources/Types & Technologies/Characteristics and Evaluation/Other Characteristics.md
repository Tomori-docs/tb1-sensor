▪ Nominal Cell Voltage: Average/rated voltage a battery
cell is designed to deliver during its discharge cycle.
▪ Cost, which is mostly determined by the battery
chemistry, materials, and manufacturing process.
– Environmental costs of battery disposal –which
depend on toxicity, material recovery, and recycling
complexity - need to be considered too.
▪ Operating temperature: Temperature impacts battery’s
electrochemical properties, efficiency, capacity, aging
mechanism, and safety. Batteries need to operate within
specific temperature limits for optimal performance.

▪ Energy Efficiency: Ratio of discharged energy to
charged energy. Energy losses are converted into heat
that must be dissipated to avoid battery overheating.
▪ Safety, as required by its application (e.g., wearables).
