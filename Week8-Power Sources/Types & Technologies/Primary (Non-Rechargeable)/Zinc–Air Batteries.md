▪ Used for consumer electronics, particularly hearing aids,
due to high energy density.
▪ It comprises a zinc anode, an air (oxygen) cathode, and
an alkaline electrolyte.
▪ Discharging operation: The air cathode enables
oxygen from the surrounding air to take part in the
electrochemical reactions and helps in the flow of
electrons, which produces electrical power.
▪ Advantages:
➢ High energy density
➢ Ideal for long-term low power and remote sensing
applications as they can remain inactive for extended
periods and provide power as required.
➢ Disadvantages:
➢ Non rechargeable
