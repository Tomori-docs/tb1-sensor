▪ Used for consumer electronics due to high energy
density, long shelf life, and consistent voltage output.
▪ They work by electrochemical reactions between the
manganese dioxide (MnO2
) cathode and the zinc (Zn)
anode, which are immersed in an alkaline electrolyte,
typically potassium hydroxide (KOH).
▪ Discharging operation: The zinc at the anode
undergoes oxidation, releasing electrons and
producing zinc oxide. At the same time,
manganese dioxide at the cathode is reduced,
consuming electrons. This flow of electrons from
anode to cathode produces electrical power.
▪ Advantages:
➢ Very low cost, stable output voltage and long shelf life
➢ Widespread availability
▪ Disadvantages:
➢ Non rechargeable
