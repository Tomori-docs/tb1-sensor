## 🫀 Pacemaker Operation Summary

leadless pacemaker.")


### Components of a Pacemaker

* **Generator ("can"):** This is a titanium case that houses the **battery**, a **microcontroller**, **memory**, a **telemetry radio**, and **output/sensing circuitry**.
* **Leads (or none, if leadless):** These are insulated wires with **electrodes** placed in the atrium, ventricle, or both. They can be **bipolar** or **unipolar**.
* **Leadless Devices:** These devices (e.g., a "capsule" in the RV - Right Ventricle) combine the **can** and the **electrode** into one unit.

### How the Pacemaker Operates

* **Sensing:** The pacemaker **senses tiny cardiac signals (millivolts)** on each lead. Its sensitivity (millivolt threshold) is **programmable**.
* **Timing Logic:** It uses timing logic to calculate the **minimum or maximum heart rate** and the **delay between atrial and ventricular events**.
* **Pacing (Stimulation):** It paces the heart with **short electrical pulses** (programmable amplitude and pulse width, typically a few volts for $0.2-0.6\,\text{ms}$) delivered via the leads, but only **if no intrinsic event arrives on time**.
