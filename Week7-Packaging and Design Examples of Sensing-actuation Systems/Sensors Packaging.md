Sensors Packaging
11
• Unlike the packaging for semiconductor devices (e.g., transistors), packaging of
sensors must allow exposure to environment.
• Sensors often need protective coatings (anti-fouling, hydrophobic, biocompatible)
while still being permeable to the target stimulus.
• Sensors may need hybrid integration with semiconductor devices, microfluidics,
electrodes, optical paths.
• The sensor packaging should withstand external stresses.
• The sensor packaging has a major influence on the performance of the device,
especially with respect to factors such as long-term drift and stability.
• The sensor package design should be developed in parallel with that of the sensor
itself since the cost of the package and its development can often be many times that
of the sensor.
