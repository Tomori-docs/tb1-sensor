• A good package must comply with a large variety of requirements: Electrical
requirements, mechanical and thermal properties, low cost.
• Function integration is one of driver for the development of new packaging
technologies.
• Monolithic integration methods allow integration of MEMS devices with
transistors.
• Packaging of sensors should not obstruct their interaction with the stimulus
and maintain electrical and mechanical requirements.
• Two examples of closed-loop sensing-actuation systems were discussed.
