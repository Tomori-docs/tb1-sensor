## 💡 Integration of MEMS with CMOS Transistors

Three monolithic integration methods:

* **CMOS first:** Transistors are first fabricated using conventional processes, and polysilicon microstructures are fabricated on top after passivating with silicon nitride ($\text{SiN}$) and a phosphosilicate glass ($\text{PSG}$) sacrificial layer.
* **MEMS first:** MEMS structures are first fabricated on the silicon wafer inside trenches filled with $\text{SiN}$ and sacrificial oxide. A polysilicon layer on top connects MEMS to transistors. Transistors are fabricated and the sacrificial oxide covering the MEMS structure is removed after fabrication of transistors.
* **Intermediate process:** The simplest form of an integrated MEMS device where the existing layers for fabricating transistors are used for the mechanical components in MEMS only with a few additional steps of masking and etching.
