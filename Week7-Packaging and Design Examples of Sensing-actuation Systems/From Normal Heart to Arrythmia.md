Heart has an electrical conduction system
which sends signals throughout the upper
chambers (atria) and lower chambers
(ventricles).
• The electric signals make the heartbeat in a
regular, coordinated rhythm. The electrical
signals are sent by the heart's sinoatrial
(SA) node. They travel across the top
chambers (atria), causing them to contract
(squeeze) and pump blood into the bottom
chambers (ventricles).
• Usually, the SA node will send the electrical signals at a steady pace, but the pace
can change depending on the emotions and if the person is active or resting.
• The speed at which the heart beats is also known as the heart rate.
• Cardiac arrhythmia is a term that covers a range of conditions where the heart beats
irregularly.
