# Future Concept of the Advanced Electronic Package
![](/file/2/r9Q0kIcjvVEL6MSEk4CZP.png)

* **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is an integrated circuit that integrates components of two or more functions on a **single platform**.
* **The disadvantages of SoC:** Long design times due to integration complexities, high wafer fabrication costs, test costs, and mixed-signal processing complexities requiring dozens of mask steps.
* An example of **MEMS sensor integration** on the same wafer (SoC) is provided in the next slide.
* For **electrically connecting different wafers in SiP**, vertical vias are etched through the thickness of the wafer using a **Deep RIE (DRIE)** process and filled with metals.
