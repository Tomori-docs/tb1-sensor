# 🔌 Standard Integrated Circuits (IC) Packages

* Microelectronic packages are often generic with **plastic, ceramic, or metal packages** being suitable for most IC applications.
* Key considerations in the design of an IC package are **reliability** (affected by packaging stresses and moisture ingress), **heat flow**, **ease and cost of manufacture**, and **electrical characteristics** such as lead resistance, capacitance, and inductance.
* **Ceramic package:** Ceramic materials like **alumina ($\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$)**, and **silicon carbide ($\text{SiC}$)**. They are more expensive than their plastic counterpart, but possess better **electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties**.
* **Plastic package:** Molded plastic packages were developed to **reduce the cost** of IC packaging.
* **Metal package:** Common metals used in the construction are **Kovar, steel, copper, molybdenum**, and **silicon carbide reinforced aluminium**. **Hermetic seals** (resistive to moisture) can be formed with these packages.
