• The conductive Ag-Ecoflex polymer layer acts as a
piezoresistive sensor, where changing in its bending
will cause strain in the material and results in
resistance changes.
• Resistance changes are converted using a
Wheatstone Bridge to voltage changes representing
changes in the bladder volume (Fig 11D, i → iii).
• Bladder volume change is communicated via
Bluetooth to an App. When the user is ready,
activates the actuator.
• The shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator is activated
by applying a voltage to the SMA spring. It then
compress the bladder for voiding (Fig 11D, iv).
• The pre-shaped PEEK layer 1 returns to its upward
bending shape after a few seconds (Fig 11D, iv → i).
