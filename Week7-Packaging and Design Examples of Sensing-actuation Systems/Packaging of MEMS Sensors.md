• Wafer level capping: Challenge: On-chip electrical interconnects from the capped
region of the die to the contact pads must not compromise the hermetic seal of the
cap. Vertical vias could assist in making through-wafer interconnects.
• Second order package: The MEMS die will be placed inside another package in a
way that the sensor is exposed to the stimulus (here pressure).
• Mechanical decoupling in the form of stress-relieving flexible regions may be
incorporated on sensor
