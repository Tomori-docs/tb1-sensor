• Ready-to-use boards that include a processor (or microprocessor), memory
and I/O devices.
• These group of boards run on an OS and hence the programming approach
looks much like a regular computer (Programming languages like Python
and C).
• A popular type of these single-board computers is the Raspberry Pi.
• A soft-core processor (like MicroBlaze) can be inside the FPGA and then
programmed with a firmware or a lightweight OS (e.g., FreeRTOS, µClinux).
