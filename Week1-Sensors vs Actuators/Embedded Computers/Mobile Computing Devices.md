• All portable devices that are delivered with a mobile OS (Android or iOS).
• The designer can develop software components (Known as apps) to control
the device’s I/O units (e.g., touch screen, sensors (accelerometer,
gyroscopes, barometers), communication interface modules (e.g., Bluetooth
and WiFi)).
• The programming of these devices is limited to a standard set of hardware,
where the OS handles the abstraction and security of low-level operations.
