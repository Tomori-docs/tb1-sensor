• Key elements in a common computer system are processor, memory, and I/O
devices. A microcomputer is a small complete computer.
• A microcontroller (µC) can be thought of as a specialized type of microcomputer
that is optimized for control tasks. µC is a single-chip device that integrates a
processor, program memory, data memory, and I/O peripherals.
• To build a µC-based application, the designer needs to connect some I/O
devices to the µC’s pins and develop the code that input/outputs data to/from
the µC.
• The most popular language for programming µCs is Embedded C; others
include Pascal, Python (e.g., MicroPython), and the Arduino language (a
simplified version of C/C++).
• PIC (Peripheral Interface Controller) is a family of microcontrollers made
by Microchip Technology.
• CPLD and FPGAs offer the possibility of building a µC core within a
reconfigurable computer (e.g., PicoBlaze 8-bit by Xilinx).
