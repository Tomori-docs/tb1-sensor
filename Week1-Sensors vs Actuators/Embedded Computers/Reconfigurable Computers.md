• Complex PLD (CPLD) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA).
• A CPLD is an advanced version of SPLD that includes gates, flip-flops, and
fast input/output (I/O) pins.
• FPGA offers more I/O pins as well as resources for the configuration of
sophisticated and high-speed designs.
• Dominant manufactures are Altera, Xilinx, Microchip Technology.
• HDL (Hardware Description Language) is the standard programming
method. Verilog and VHDL are the most widely used HDLs.
➢ In contrast to conventional programming method of computers (i.e., the
sequential programming where statements are executed in their order of
occurrence in the code), HDLS introduce concurrency (i.e., statements
are executed simultaneously).
