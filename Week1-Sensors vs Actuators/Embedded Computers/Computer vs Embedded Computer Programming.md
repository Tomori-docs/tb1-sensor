• A personal computer interacts with hardware through a software layer known
as the operating system (OS).
• Developers use programming languages (e.g., C, Python, Java) together
with application programming interfaces (APIs), which provide access to OS
services and hardware resources.
• Using APIs, a developer calls functions to perform input/output (I/O)
operations with the computer system (e.g., reading from the keyboard or
writing to the display).
• An embedded system may or may not use an OS; if it does the focus is often
on efficient software design (e.g., in automotive airbag system that
multitasking is important), while without an OS, the focus is on direct
hardware interaction (e.g., Microwave oven controller).
