The closed-loop system can be ‘feedforward’
or ‘feedback’.
• Imagine a precision temperature control in an
industrial furnace:
➢ Feedforward: The controller knows
when a cold metal batch is about to
enter the furnace and pre-emptively
increases power to compensate for the
expected heat loss (based on the mass
and temperature of the incoming metal).
➢ Feedback: A temperature sensor
continuously measures the actual
furnace temperature. The controller
compares it to the setpoint and adjusts
heating if there’s any deviation.
