A smart system consists of a sensor, an actuator and a control system.
• The aim of a control system is to inject a control force onto the system to
perform a desired operation.
• These instructions are given to the actuator using a suitable control law that is
driven by a set of control algorithms. => The control law could be open-loop
or closed-loop.
➢ Open-loop system: Relies on pre-set inputs.
➢ Closed-loop system: Uses sensed feedback to maintain a desired output.
