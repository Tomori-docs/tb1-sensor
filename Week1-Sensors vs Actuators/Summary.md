• Sensors convert mechanical inputs into electrical outputs. Actuators work in
reverse.
• A smart system integrates sensors, actuators, and a control system that
applies either open-loop (pre-set inputs) or closed-loop (feedforward- or
feedback-based) control laws to achieve desired operations.
• An embedded computer is any electronic device (Contained in a hardware
system) that can be programmed (With some kind of code) to carry out some
computing.
• There are five categories of embedded computers: PLDS, reconfigurable
computers, microcomputers, single-board computers, and mobile computing
devices.
• A µC can be thought of as a specialized type of microcomputer that is
optimized for control tasks.
