 A transducer is a device that converts energy from one form into another.
=> An umbrella term for both sensors and actuators.
• Sensors convert measurands (Mechanical inputs) into appropriate
measurement values (Electrical outputs).
➢ Can be classified as active or passive. => If a sensor does not need an
external energy to do the conversion, it is classified as a passive sensor.
• In contrast to sensors, (electromechanical) actuators convert electrical
quantities (Inputs) into mechanical (Outputs).
• Conversion principle: Principles to convert mechanical into electrical
quantities and vice versa. => Some principles work in both directions.
