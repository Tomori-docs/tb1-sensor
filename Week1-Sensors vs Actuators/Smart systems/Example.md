• A drone is built around sensors (e.g.,
accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, GPS,
Camera), actuators (DC motors), a control
unit (µC), and radio frequency (RF) modules.
• The RF module is used to receive data from
the remote controller.
• The communication between µC and sensors
is I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit).
• I2C protocol is a protocol intended to allow
multiple "peripheral" digital integrated circuits
("chips") to communicate with one or more
"controller" chips.
• The communication between µC and RF
modules is Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
or UART (Universal Asynchronous
Receiver/Transmitter).
• The SPI is based on a synchronous type of
serial communication that is synchronized by
a common clock.
• UART is asynchronous.
• More on communication or interfacing
protocols in Week 2.
• The key component in a smart system that
allows creativity and innovation, is the Sensor
Devices.
