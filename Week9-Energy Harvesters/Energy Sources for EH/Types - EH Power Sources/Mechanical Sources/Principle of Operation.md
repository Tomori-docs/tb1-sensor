▪ Capturing mechanical energy from vibration, motion, or
deformation and converting it to electricity
▪ Principle of Operation
▪ Electrostatic transduction: Production of electricity is based on
relative motion in between two plates/electrodes of a capacitor.
Vibration or motion from an external source causes a relative
movement between the two plates, which generates a
capacitance variation and then electric charges.
▪ Electromagnetic transduction: Production of electricity is based
on magnetic flux variation in a coil due to relative motion of a
magnet. It is ruled by Faraday's Law
▪ Piezoelectric transduction: Production of electricity is based on
deformation (e.g., through vibration or motion) of piezoelectric
materials creates, which create electrical charge.
