### Electrostatic transduction:

* Energy stored in a capacitor: $E = \frac{1}{2}CV^2$
* Mechanical work changes **capacitance** $C \rightarrow E$
* Detailed model and equivalent circuit (current or voltage source) depend on whether operation is **charge- ($Q$)** or **voltage- ($V$)** constrained

### Electromagnetic transduction:

* Faraday's law: $\mathcal{E} = -N\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$, where $\mathcal{E}$ is **induced emf**, $N$ is **number of coil turns**, and $\Phi$ is **magnetic flux**.

### Piezoelectric transduction:

* For piezoelectricity, **charge** depends on the **piezoelectric constant** and the **force**
