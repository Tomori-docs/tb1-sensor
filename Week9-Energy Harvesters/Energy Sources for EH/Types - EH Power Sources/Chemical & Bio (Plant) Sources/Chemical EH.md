## 🔋 Bioenergy Harvesting / Fuel Cells

### Principle of Operation

* Harvesting electrical energy from chemical reactions, often from **biological or waste materials**.
* **Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs):** Bacteria oxidise organic compounds (e.g., waste), releasing electrons, which are collected at the anode and transferred to the cathode, generating an electric voltage.
* **Plant microbial fuel cells** bioenergy harvesting.
* **Enzymatic Biofuel Cells:** Use enzymes to catalyse reactions and produce electricity.

### Equations/Models

* Power generation depends on **metabolic rate, internal resistance, substrate concentration, electrode surface area**, etc.
* The **output power** of an MFC single unit is **extremely low**, but a proper arrangement of MFCs in **parallel and series** can generate enough voltage and current.

### 👍 Advantages:

* Uses **widely available waste** (biological, organic).
* Potentially **continuous** (if substrate is available).
* Useful in environments rich in **biomass/organic matter** (e.g., wastewater, soil).

### 👎 Disadvantages:

* Very **low power per cell** $\rightarrow$ needs series/parallel configuration.
* **Maintenance:** biological systems may **degrade over time**.
* **Scalability:** large physical size may be needed for significant power.
* **Slow response, low power density.**
