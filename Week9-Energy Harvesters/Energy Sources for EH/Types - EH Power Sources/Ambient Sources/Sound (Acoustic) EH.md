## 🔊 Sound (Acoustic) EH

### Definition
* Harvesting mechanical energy from ambient acoustic waves (**sound**) and converting it to electrical energy.

### Principle of Operation
* Sound waves cause **pressure oscillations**; these can drive deformation in **piezoelectric materials** or **triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs)**.
* In triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), two materials repeatedly contact and separate due to acoustic pressure, generating charges via the **triboelectric effect**.
    * The triboelectric effect describes **electric charge transfer** between two objects when they contact or slide against each other.

### Equations/Models
* Depend on the device/architecture.

### Advantages
* It can use ambient acoustic noise as an energy source.

### Disadvantages
* Energy available from sound is often **low and highly variable**: Acoustic sources may not have consistent amplitude or frequency.
* Due to **inherent frequency mismatches** between regular sound wave frequencies, there may be a significant energy loss during this energy harvesting.
* Mechanical design can be complex; **long-term durability** can be a concern.
