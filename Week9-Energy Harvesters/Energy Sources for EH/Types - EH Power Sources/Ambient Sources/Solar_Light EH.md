**Ambient**

## Solar/Light EH

* Harvesting energy from light (sun or artificial), usually via photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert photons into electrical energy.

### Principle of Operation

* PV cells are made of semiconductor materials (commonly Si) with P-type and N-type layers. Photons hitting the cell cause electrons to be released, and a current is generated.

### Equations/Models:

* **Power generated by a PV cell**
    $$P_{\text{out}} = \eta G A$$
* $\eta = \text{cell efficiency}$, $G = \text{solar irradiance (W/m}^2\text{)}$ and $A = \text{cell area (m}^2\text{)}$

## Solar nano-rectenna

Solar nano-rectennas can also be used. They capture electromagnetic waves in the near IR, visible, and UV range, and transfers part of the captured power to a rectifier, which transforms this power into DC power.

## 🔆 Solar/Light EH

### **Advantages:**

* **Mature Technology:** Well-established technology with extensive research and development.
* **Relatively high power density under good illumination** ($\sim 100 \text{ mW/cm}^2$ in daylight).

### **Disadvantages:**

* **It can be intermittent:** In the case of solar EH, no power at night, lower output under shading or bad weather.
* **PV output varies nonlinearly with irradiance & temperature.** It requires **Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)** techniques to find and maintain the optimal operating voltage and current that yields the max available power.
* **Indoor/artificial light harvesting is less efficient** ($\sim 1/3$ solar).
