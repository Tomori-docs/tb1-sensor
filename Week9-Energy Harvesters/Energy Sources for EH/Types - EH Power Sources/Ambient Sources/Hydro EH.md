## 🌊 Hydro EH (Energy Harvesting)

* Converting **kinetic or mechanical energy** from flowing, falling, or oscillating water into electrical energy.

### **Principle of Operation**

* **Hydro turbines** are placed in water flow; moving water causes blades to rotate, which turns a generator.
* **Piezoelectric beams or membranes** or other transducers can be placed in oscillating or pulsating water flow to convert oscillations to electricity.

### **Equations/Models**

* Power generated by a hydro turbine $P_T$:
    $$P_T = \rho g Q H$$
    * $\rho$ = water/liquid density
    * $g$ = gravitational acceleration
    * $Q$ = flowrate
    * $H$ = height

### **✅ Advantages**

* **Reliable in water-rich environments:** Water flow can be continuous (pipes, rivers), providing sustained energy.
* **High power density** compared to many other ambient sources: Even slow-moving water carries much more kinetic energy than wind at the same velocity.
* **Predictable behavior:** Water systems such as pipelines have stable flow rates, enabling predictable power output.

### **❌ Disadvantages**

* Not suitable outside **water-flow or submerged contexts**.
* **Biofouling and sedimentation:** Algae growth, sediment, debris can reduce efficiency or jam micro-turbines.
* Long-term exposure to water may cause **corrosion or material fatigue**, especially in harsh or saline environments.
