## 🌬️ Wind Energy Harvesting (Wind EH)

### **Definition & Principle of Operation**

* **Harvesting energy** from ambient wind flow by converting the **kinetic energy** of air movement to electrical power.
* **Principle of Operation:**
    * Use of **fluttering or flag-like structures** (e.g., inverted piezoelectric flag) that oscillate when exposed to wind.
    * The motion of the structure deforms **piezoelectric material**, generating electricity.

### **Equations/Models**

* Power generated by a wind turbine $P_T$ is given by:
    $$P_T = C_P P_0 = C_P \frac{\rho A v^3}{2}$$
* **Variables:**
    * $C_P$ = turbine performance coefficient
    * $P_0$ = max wind power available
    * $\rho$ = air density
    * $v$ = wind speed
    * $A$ = turbine's swept area

### **Advantages**

* **Effective** in outdoor, **windy environments**.
* Can harness energy even at **moderate wind speeds**.
* **Small-scale designs** possible (flags).

### **Disadvantages**

* **Intermittent:** dependent on wind availability & speed.
* **Mechanical fatigue** of oscillating structures.
* **Design complexity:** geometry must be finely tuned (size, stiffness, mass).
* **Noise and vibration issues** in sensitive deployments.
