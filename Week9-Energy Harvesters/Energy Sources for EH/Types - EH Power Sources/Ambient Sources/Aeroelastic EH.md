## 🌬️ Aeroelastic EH (Energy Harvesting)

Aeroelastic Energy Harvesting (EH) exploits vibrations in structures caused by fluid flow (e.g., air) to generate electricity via material deformation, typically using the piezoelectric effect.

### Principle of Operation

* A structure (e.g., a wing or flap) exposed to airflow can enter **flutter** or **galloping** oscillations once a threshold (flutter) velocity is reached.
* These oscillations are transferred to a piezoelectric cantilever, which deforms and generates voltage via the piezoelectric effect.

### Equations/Models

* Detailed aeroelastic modeling (fluid-structure interaction) is complex and typically uses **coupled differential equations** (structural dynamics + aerodynamics).

### ✅ Advantages

* Suitable for environments with significant airflow (e.g., **aerospace**, **tall structures**).
* Can **continuously harvest** energy if flow persists above a threshold.
* Potential for powering **wireless sensors** on moving/flapping structures.

### ❌ Disadvantages

* Design is **complex** due to the need to model fluid-structure interaction.
* Requires **precise tuning** (flutter speed, material, geometry).
* Mechanical **fatigue/durability issues** in long-term operation.
* May require **large or specific structures** (wings or flaps).
