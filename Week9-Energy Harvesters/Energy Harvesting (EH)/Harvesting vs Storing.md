▪ Energy harvesting: to capture energy from ambient and/or
external sources (e.g., light, heat, vibration, or radio waves)
and convert it into a usable (electrical) power
▪ Types of energy-harvesting architectures:
a. Harvest‒Use: nodes are directly powered by the
energy-harvesting system. Nodes are disabled if
sufficient energy cannot be harvested
b. Harvest‒Store‒Use: energy harvested is stored for
future use
▪ Harvesting versus storing
▪ A battery stores a finite amount of energy and
depletes over time (finite)
▪ An energy harvester draws from a continuous source
and operates if that source is available (continuous)
