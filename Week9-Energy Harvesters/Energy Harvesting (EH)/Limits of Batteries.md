▪ Limitations of battery-operated devices:
– Leakage and/or self-discharge can lead to
battery depletion even during periods of inactivity
– Environmental constraints: Battery performance
degrades in harsh conditions, causing capacity and
power losses
– Size & weight trade-off: Larger and heavier
batteries are required to increase capacity
– Environmental impact: Hazardous chemicals
make batteries difficult to recycle and dispose of
safely
