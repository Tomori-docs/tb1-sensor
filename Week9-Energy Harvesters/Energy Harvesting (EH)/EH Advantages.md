▪ Energy harvesters (EHs) tend to
– Be economical, simple and more sustainable to
fabricate (e.g., compatible with biodegradable, biocompatible and green materials/substrates)
– Require less frequent maintenance, produce fewer
carbon emissions than battery-based systems
– Integrate easily with wireless comms networks
▪ We can also use hybrid energy harvesting techniques
(integration of multiple energy sources to reduce the
deficiencies of a single energy source)
