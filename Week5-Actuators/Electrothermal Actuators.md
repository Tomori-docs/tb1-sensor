• Rely on joule heating generated by current flowing through part of the structure, which
results in displacement via thermal expansion.
• Two groups: (1) Those using materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion
(CTE) (bimorph actuator, e.g., metal vs SiO₂) and (2) those using differences in
electrical resistance achieved by geometric design (chevron/V-type and hot-arm/coldarm).

actuators: (a) Side view of a

• For bimorph actuator, when the temperature increases,
the difference in expansion between the materials results
in displacement.

• For other actuators, the geometry defines the resistance
and, consequently, the amount of thermal expansion. The
hot-arm is kept long and narrow (increased resistivity),
while the cold-arm is short and wide (reduced resistivity),
so that, under actuation, the structure rotates towards the
cold-arm. For the V-type actuator, linear displacement is
achieved by using a V-shape geometry where symmetric
thermal expansion causes the structure to move in the
direction of the vertex
