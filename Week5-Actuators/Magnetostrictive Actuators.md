• While the characteristic property of electrostrictive materials is the production of strain
on the application of an electric field, in magnetostrictive materials mechanical strain
is produced by the application of a magnetic field.
• Usually, magnetostrictive materials operate in the longitudinal mode.
• The magnetostrictive actuator (vibrator) below consists of an E-shaped core of iron–
gallium alloy (Galfenol), drive coil and iron fixtures. A coil is wound on the centre leg
of the core. With current flowing in the coil, a close magnetic loop is constructed in the
core with fixtures. Both positive and negative magnetizations cause positive
magnetostriction, thus, the magnetic flux passing along the three legs produces the
same elongation in the longitudinal direction.
