## Summary of Actuator Types ⚙️


| Actuator Type | Key Effect (Mechanism) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Electrostatic** (Parallel-plate/comb) | Voltage $\rightarrow$ Mechanical movement |
| **Electromagnetic** (Solenoid wound around yoke and moving-plate) | Current in coil $\rightarrow$ Magnetic field $\rightarrow$ Mechanical movement |
| **Electrodynamic** (Solenoid wound around a movable pole and placed in a magnetic field) | Lorentz force on a current passing through solenoid in a static magnetic field $\rightarrow$ Mechanical movement |
| **Piezoelectric** | Converse piezoelectric effect (Voltage $\rightarrow$ Mechanical deformation) |
| **Electrostrictive** | Similar to piezoelectric |
| **Magnetostrictive** (Solenoid wound around E-shape core) | Current in coil $\rightarrow$ Magnetic field $\rightarrow$ Mechanical elongation |
| **Thermal** (bimorph/chevron or hot-/cold-arm) | Thermal expansion |

### Additional Note

* Key parameters in actuator's performance include **stroke**, **linearity**, **energy density**, **efficiency**, **speed**, etc.
