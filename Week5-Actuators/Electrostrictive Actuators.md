• Electrostriction is the phenomenon of mechanical deformation of a material due to an
applied electric field. This is a fundamental phenomenon which is present to varying
degrees in all materials and occurs due to the presence of polarizable atoms and
molecules.
• An applied electric field can distort the charge distribution within the material, resulting
in modifications to bond length, bond angle or electron distribution functions, which in
turn affects the macroscopic dimensions of the material.
• The phenomenon of electrostriction is very similar to piezoelectricity but there are
some differences.

• Lead magnesium niobate (PMN) is an electrostrictive ceramic which exhibits an order
of magnitude more strain than most piezoceramics for the same electric field strength.
• Polymeric thin-film materials with compliant graphite electrodes have been shown to
have excellent electrostrictive properties.
• The equivalent circuit for an electrostricive bar that poled along its length and has
electrodes on its ends is shown below:
