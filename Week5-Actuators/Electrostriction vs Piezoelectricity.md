## ⚡ Electrostriction vs Piezoelectricity

* The **piezoelectric material** has a spontaneous polarization $P_s$ due to the asymmetric crystal structure. Under the action of a polarization electric field $E_{pol}$, $P_s$ reorientates toward the $E_{pol}$. After the polarization electric field is removed, the material still retains a polarization $P_r$. Under the excitation of an external AC electric field, the material will extend and contract alternately, yielding positive and negative strains.
* The **polarization in electrostrictive materials is field induced**. Electrostriction is a measure of the polarization induced by ions shifting away from their natural equilibrium positions.
* In **centrosymmetric crystals**, the induced shifts of equivalent ions almost cancel each other out, while the difference in the shifts because of applied field generates strain (i.e., the extension of the lattice).
