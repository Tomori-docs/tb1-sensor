• Due to its simplicity, electrostatic actuation is the most preferred, especially in micro
devices. However, these devices require greater environmental protection as
electrostatic.
• Electromagnetic and electrodynamic actuators are based on Lorentz force effects.
The current-carrying coil is stationary in the former case, while in the latter it is
moving. These are ideally suited when large currents are possible, even if with lower
voltages. This is required to generate strong magnetic fields. However, they are prone
to problems with power dissipation but are tolerant to dust and humidity.
• Actuators based on piezoelectricity, magnetostriction and electrostriction depend on
changes in strain produced by an applied electric or magnetic field in some special
materials used. The achievable strain is at a maximum for electrostrictive materials,
but the force generated is at a maximum in magnetostrictive materials.
• Both electrostrictive and piezoelectric materials deform with the application of an
electric field, but while the relationship between the force produced and applied field
is linear in piezoelectrics, it is quadratic in electrostrictive materials.

• Most of these transduction schemes are non-linear. That is, the transfer function
between electrical (voltage or current) and mechanical (force or displacement) is not
linear. Such non-linearities distort the sensed signal.
• One approach to overcome this difficulty is to restrict the signal to very small
variations about a DC bias. It is reasonable to assume that the responses to these
small signal variations are linear.
• A brief comparison of some of the actuators are shown below:
