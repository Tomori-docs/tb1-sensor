* **Young's modulus ($E$):** A measure of the **stiffness** of a material with unit in Pascal (Pa). It quantifies how much a material resists deformation under stress (force per unit area). Specifically, it relates **stress ($\sigma$)** to **strain ($\varepsilon$)** in the linear elastic region of a material's stress–strain curve:

    $$E = \sigma / \varepsilon$$

    where, $\sigma = F/A$ (Force $F$ applied over area $A$) and $\varepsilon = \Delta L / L$ (change in length $\Delta L$ divided by original length $L$).

* **Hooke's law for springs:** The extension of an elastic material is directly proportional to the applied force, provided the material has not exceeded its elastic limit.

    $$F = kx$$

    where, $F$ is the applied force, $x$ is extension (displacement), and $k$ is the spring constant (stiffness, N/m).

* **Hooke's law for solid materials:** $\sigma = E\varepsilon$

* **Neural Network:** A neural network is a computational model inspired by the way biological brains process information. It is made up of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that can learn to perform tasks like classification, prediction, or pattern recognition.

* **Epoch:** One complete pass of the entire training dataset through the learning algorithm.

* **Iteration:** One update of the model's parameters using a subset (called a **batch**) of the training data.
