## 📝 Pre-lecture Review Notes (Week 4) - F.A.Hassani

### **Light Scattering**
Refers to the process by which light is deflected or redirected when it interacts with particles, atoms, or irregularities in a medium — instead of traveling straight through.

### **Rayleigh Scattering**
Elastic scattering of light by particles much smaller than the wavelength of light (e.g., air molecules).
> (Elastic: scattered photons have the same energy (same wavelength) as incident photons.)

### **Raman Scattering**
Inelastic scattering of light caused by interaction with vibrational or rotational energy levels of molecules.
> (Inelastic: scattered photons have different energy than the incident photons.)

### **PIN Photodetectors**

### **Avalanche-type Photodiodes**
An avalanche photodiode (APD) is a highly sensitive semiconductor photodetector that converts light into electrical current — similar to a regular photodiode — but with internal gain due to an **avalanche multiplication process**.

#### Working principle:
* APDs are typically made from p-i-n structures.
* They are reverse-biased at a high voltage (usually 50–400 V).
* When a photon enters the depletion region, it generates an electron-hole pair.
* Under the strong electric field, these charge carriers are accelerated to high kinetic energy.
* These energetic carriers collide with the crystal lattice and create additional electron-hole pairs by **impact ionization**.
* This leads to a chain reaction called an **avalanche**, multiplying the current.
