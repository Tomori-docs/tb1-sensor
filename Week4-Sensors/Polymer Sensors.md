## 🔬 Polymer Sensors

* Polymer sensors are particularly advantageous in **'moderate-performance' devices** which are **low cost or disposable**.
* They may be divided into two categories.
    * The first group uses polymer materials with the **piezoelectric properties** (e.g., poly(vinylidene fluoride) **(PVDF)** and and its copolymer **P(VDF-TrFE)**).
    * The second group uses **piezoresistive materials** (e.g., PDMS-silver nanoparticle composite).
* Some unique features of piezoelectric polymers that make them attractive for use as sensing elements include:
    * Their relatively **low acoustic impedance**.
    * **Broadband acoustic performance**.
    * **Flexible form** and availability in **large area films**.
    * Ability to be **dissolved and coated onto various substrates**.
* **PVDF** is a semicrystalline high-molecular-weight polymer formed by the linking together of simple 1,1-difluoroethylene **(VDF)** molecules.
    * PVDF is approximately **half crystalline and half amorphous**.
    * The half **crystalline** part can become **polar** by mechanically stretching or rolling at elevated temperatures.
    * The **amorphous** regions are disordered and don't have a fixed dipole orientation, but their dipoles can be **influenced (rotated) by an external electric field**.
