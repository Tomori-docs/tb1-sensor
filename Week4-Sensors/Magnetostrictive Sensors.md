## 🧲 Magnetostrictive Sensors

### Magnetostriction and Operational Principle

* **Magnetostriction:** Domains in a ferromagnetic material are randomly oriented in their demagnetized forms. However, when a magnetic field is applied, these domains become oriented along the direction of the field. This alignment results in microscopic forces between these domains, hence **mechanical deformation** of the material (Magnetostrictive effect).
* In reverse, mechanical deformation can cause orientation of the domains, so resulting in **induction** at the macroscopic level (Villarri effect).

#### Operational Principle

The operational principle of a magnetostrictive sensor involves the following steps:

1.  A **Current pulse** is applied to one end of the magnetostrictive wire.
2.  A **Circular magnetic field** is generated, encompassing the entire wire.
3.  The **Magnetic field from the position magnet** and the **circular magnetic field** interact.
4.  This interaction produces a **strain pulse** (Torsional oscillation).
5.  The **Travel time** of the strain pulse to the pick-up is **proportional to the distance** the pulse travels.
6.  The **time elapsed is measured** multiple times.

### Electromechanical Equivalent Circuit and Materials

#### Equivalent Circuit

* The pickup circuit could be a **coil** or a **piezoceramic transducer**.
* The equivalent electromechanical circuit for the sensor consists of electrical and mechanical components and a transformer.
* The ratio of the 'turns' of this transformer is decided by the amount of **electromechanical coupling**.
* The **electromechanical coupling coefficient** is defined as the ratio of the energy stored in the mechanical circuit to the total input energy.

The circuit components model the following:
* **Damper:** To model mechanical and magnetic losses.
* **Transformer (in the dashed box):** To model electrical to mechanical conversion.
* **Pickup coil inductance** and **Wire inductance**.

#### Common Materials

Ferrites, and metallic alloys, are some of the common materials used in magnetostrictive transducers:

* **'Permalloy'** ($45\%$ Ni + $55\%$ Fe)
* **'Alfer'** ($13\%$ Al + $87\%$ Fe)
* **'Alcofer'** ($12\%$ Al + $2\%$ Co + $86\%$ Fe)
