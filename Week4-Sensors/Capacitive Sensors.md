## 🧲 Capacitive Sensors

* Capacitive sensors consist of a pair of electrodes arranged in such a way that one of the electrodes moves when the input variable (**pressure**, **force**, etc.) is applied.
* While the simplest configuration consists of capacitors with two parallel plate electrodes, capacitors with **interdigitated fingers** have gained wide acceptance, as they allow for **larger linear sensing ranges**.
* In a parallel plate capacitor, the capacitance $C$ is given by:
    $$C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d} \quad \text{(Eq 1)}$$
    Where:
    * $\epsilon$: The **dielectric permittivity**
    * $A$: The **area of the electrode**
    * $d$: The **dielectric thickness**
* In **capacitive microsensors**, the capacitance change is not usually linear with respect to deformation. Changes in the structure may be performed to improve linearity.
* Capacitive sensing has **higher performance** than piezoresistive sensing in applications requiring **high sensitivity**, **low pressure ranges**, and **high stability**.
