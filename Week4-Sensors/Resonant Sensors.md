* Resonant sensors are based on measuring the **resonant frequency $(f)$** of the mechanical vibration of beams or diaphragms. The applied strain causes changes in the resonant frequency, enabling measurement of input variables such as **pressure, acceleration, rate and temperature**. Resonant frequency pickup can use any of the sensing technologies discussed previously.
* A **micro resonant pressure sensor** consists of a frame, a thin diaphragm and a double-clamped micro beam suspended above a cavity with a **driving electrode** beneath the beam on the bottom of the cavity.
    > *See Fig. 10. A micro resonant pressure sensor.*
* The beam vibrates by applying an **AC signal** to the driving electrode. The vibration of the beam can be sensed by the **piezoresistors**. The signal output is sent to a circuit consisting of amplifiers, detectors, automatic gain control, etc., and then fed back to the driving electrode to maintain a **close-loop oscillation** with constant amplitude at the resonant frequency.
* With an applied pressure $(p)$ on the back of the diaphragm, the diaphragm deforms in direct proportion to $p$. The deformation, stretches the beam and changes $f$. $\implies p \propto f$.
