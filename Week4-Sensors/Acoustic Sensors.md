* Acoustic sensors operate by converting electrical energy into **acoustic waves**, the propagation characteristics of which could be influenced by the physical parameter being measured and converting this back to electrical energy for further processing.
* The type of acoustic wave generated in a **piezoelectric material** depends mainly on the substrate material properties, the crystal cut, and the structure of the electrodes utilized to transform the electrical energy into mechanical energy.
* **Surface acoustic wave (SAW)-based sensors** form an important part of the sensor family and have seen diverse applications ranging from gas and vapor detection to strain measurement.
* A SAW device consists of a **piezoelectric wafer**, **inter digitated electrodes (IDTs)**, and **reflectors** on the edges. IDTs are used for exciting as well as detecting the SAW.
* If a harmonic voltage, $v = v_0 \exp(j\omega t)$, is applied to the electrodes, the stress induced by a finger pair travels along the surface of the crystal in both directions. To ensure **constructive interference** and **in-phase stress**, the distance between two neighbouring fingers should be equal to half the **elastic wavelength**, $\lambda_R$.
