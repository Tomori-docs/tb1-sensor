## 🔊 Noise in Sensors and Circuits

* Noise may present a **substantial source of errors** and should be seriously considered.
* There are **two basic types of noise**:
    * **Inherent noise** which is noise arising **within** the sensor/circuit.
    * **Interference (transmitted) noise** which is noise picked up from **outside** the sensor/circuit.

### Inherent Noise
* **Thermal (Johnson–Nyquist) noise** in all resistive/conductive paths due to random thermal motion of charge carriers.
* **Shot noise** in devices with current flow across junctions (e.g., photodiodes, PN junction sensors).
* **1/f (Flicker) noise** in semiconductors, MOSFETs, thin films due to trapping and release of charge carriers at defects, impurities, or interfaces inside semiconductors.
* **Generation–recombination noise** in semiconductors (due to carrier trapping/release).
* **Circuit/electronics noise** in amplifiers, ADCs, references used inside the sensor module.

### Interference Noise
* **Electromagnetic interference (EMI):** From power lines, RF sources, switching circuits.
* **Mechanical vibrations/acoustic noise:** External mechanical coupling to MEMS, piezo, strain sensors.
* **Temperature fluctuations:** External thermal environment causing drift.
* **Quantization noise (ADC):** From external digitization stage (not the raw sensing element).
