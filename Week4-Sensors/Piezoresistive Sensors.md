## ⚡️ Piezoresistive Sensors

* **Piezoresistive effect:** The change in the electrical resistance of a material when it is subjected to **mechanical strain** (stretching or compressing).
* An example of a piezoresistive microsensor includes resistors that are built on a **silicon diaphragm**. The deflection of the diaphragm leads to the dimensional change of the resistors, hence resulting in the resistance changing due to the piezoresistive effect in silicon.

The governing equation for the change in resistance is:
$$\frac{\Delta R}{R} = (1 + 2\nu) \frac{\Delta l}{l} + \frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho} \quad \text{(Eq 5)}$$

Where the variables are defined as:
* **$\Delta R$**: Change of the resistance
* **$R$**: Original resistance
* **$\nu$**: Poisson ratio
* **$\Delta l$**: Length change of the resistor
* **$l$**: Original length of the resistor
* **$\Delta\rho$**: Resistivity change of the resistor
* **$\rho$**: Resistivity of the resistor

* Typically, four piezoresistors are connected into a **Wheatstone bridge configuration** to reduce temperature errors.
* **Examples of materials** with piezoresistive property:
    * Metals ($\text{Pt}$)
    * Semiconductors ($\text{Si}$)
    * Polymeric/carbon-based materials ($\text{PEDOT:PSS}$, carbon nanotube ($\text{CNT}$)-based composites)
    * Ceramics and oxides (Tin oxide ($\text{SnO}_2$)).
