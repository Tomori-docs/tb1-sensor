• When pressure is applied on a section of a conductor its dimension changes, causing
a change in its resistance. This change, although it is usually very small in magnitude,
can be detected by using a resistance Wheatstone bridge circuit, and the detected
output is the differential voltage which is proportional to the applied pressure.
• A very popular example of such a sensor is the strain gauge.
• When pressure is applied to the structure attached to the strain gauge, the lengths of
the metal strips increase, and their widths decrease. These changes cause an
increase in the resistance.
