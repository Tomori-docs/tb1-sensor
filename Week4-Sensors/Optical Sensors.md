## 💡 Optical Sensors

* Optical sensors are based on measuring either the **intensity change** in one or more light beams (**intensity sensors**) or **phase changes** in the light beams (**interferometric sensors**) caused by their interaction or interference.
* The techniques used in the case of intensity sensors include **light scattering** (both Rayleigh and Raman), **spectral transmission changes** (i.e., simple attenuation of transmitted light due to absorption), **microbending** or **radiative losses**, **reflectance changes** and **changes in the modal properties of the fiber**.
* The simplest optical intensity sensor is a **photodetector**. In a **reverse-biased P-N junction detector**, electron-hole pairs generated by the incident optical energy increases the carrier density. **PIN** and **avalanche-type photodiodes** are also used in several applications.

* **Interferometric sensors**, are based on **magneto-optic effect** (Changes of a material’s optical properties in the presence of a magnetic field), **Doppler effect** (Changes of the frequency of the scattered light depending on the velocity of the surface or particles relative to the light source), or **Sagnac effect** (Changes of the phase of the light between two beams of light traveling in opposite directions).
* The radiation of the laser diode is coupled into the fiber and propagates partially through the coupler towards the mirror. At the tip of the fiber, a part of the radiation is internally reflected, and the other part goes out, gets reflected by the mirror and is picked up again by the fiber.
* The intensity of the optical radiation at the photodetector is periodically changed, depending on the distance between the fiber and mirror.
* The displacement of the mirror changes the path length difference of the interfering rays, resulting in one period variation of the radiation intensity at the photodetector.
