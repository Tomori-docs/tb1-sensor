## 💡 Sensors Key Parameters

### 📏 Static and Error Parameters

| Parameter | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sensitivity** | Ratio of **change in output** to **change in input**. |
| **Resolution** | Smallest detectable change in the **input quantity**. |
| **Range (span)** | A dynamic range of stimuli that may be converted by a sensor. |
| **Accuracy (Inaccuracy)** | Highest deviation of a value represented by the sensor from the **ideal or true value** of a stimulus at its input. |
| **Calibration error** | The inaccuracy level that is **permitted** when a sensor is calibrated in the factory. |
| **Hysteresis** | A deviation of the sensor's output at a specified point of the input signal when it approached from the **opposite directions**. |
| **Linearity** | How closely the sensor output follows a **straight line** relation with input. |
| **Saturation** | Occurs when the input signal is so large that the sensor (or its electronics) can no longer increase its output **proportionally**. |
| **Repeatability** | A maximum difference between the output readings by **two cycle**. |
| **Dead band** | The **insensitivity** of the sensor in a specific range of the input signals. |

### 🕰️ Dynamic and Practical Parameters

* **Stability:** The ability of a sensor to maintain its performance (output, accuracy, sensitivity) **over time** under constant conditions.
* **Response time:** Time taken for the sensor to reach a certain % of final output after a step input (often $63\%$ or $90\%$).
* **Bandwidth/frequency response:** Range of frequencies over which the sensor can accurately track input changes.
* **Operating life:** The period of time over which a sensor can perform within its specified performance parameters before **significant degradation** occurs.
* **Cost:** The monetary expenditure associated with the sensor.
* **Form factor:** The physical size, shape, and geometry of the sensor, including how it can be packaged or integrated into a system.
* **Selectivity (Specificity):** The ability of a sensor to respond **only to the target measurand** (the desired input) and not to other interfering inputs.
* **Power consumption:** Important for portable/wearable sensors.
* **Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR):** Ratio of **useful signal** to **background noise**.
