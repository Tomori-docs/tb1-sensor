## 🌡️ Temperature Sensors

* A temperature sensor is a device that **detects temperature** and converts it into an **electrical signal** (Voltage, current, or resistance) that can be measured and processed.

* Types of temperature sensors where the sensor should **touch the object**:
    * **Thermocouples (TC):** Two dissimilar metals joined at one end $\rightarrow$ Generate **voltage** proportional to temperature (Seebeck effect).
    * **Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTD):** **Resistance** of metals (e.g., platinum Pt100) changes with temperature.
    * **Thermistors:** Semiconductor or conductive polymer composite resistors with temperature dependence:
        * **NTC** (negative temperature coefficient): Resistance **decreases** with temperature.
        * **PTC** (positive temperature coefficient): Resistance **increases** with temperature.

* **Non-contact temperature sensors** that measure infrared radiation (IR): IR thermopiles/pyrometers: Detect emitted infrared radiation $\rightarrow$ Calculate temperature.
