## ⚡ Piezoelectric Sensors

### Principles of Operation

* **Piezoelectric effect:** An electrical charge is generated when a mechanical stress $(\sigma)$ is applied to a piezoelectric film. The **converse effect** is also observed in such materials.
* **Piezoelectricity** is attributed to an **asymmetry in the unit cell** (The smallest repeating structural block of a crystal lattice) and the resultant generation of electric polarization dipoles due to the mechanical distortion.
* Examples of such materials include **lead zirconate titanate (PZT)**, lead metaniobate, lead titanate, and their modifications.

### Key Equations and Definitions

The relationship between the dipole moment and the mechanical deformation is expressed by:

$$
\sigma = cS - eE \quad \text{(Eq 3)}
$$

$$
D = \varepsilon_0 E + eS \quad \text{(Eq 4)}
$$

| Symbol | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| $\sigma$ | Mechanical stress ($\text{N/m}^2$) |
| $S$ | Strain |
| $E$ | Electric field ($\text{V/m}$) |
| $D$ | Electric flux density ($\text{C/m}^2$) |
| $c$ | Elastic stiffness constant |
| $e$ | Piezoelectric constant |
| $g$ | Piezoelectric voltage coefficient ($\text{Vm/N}$) |
| $\varepsilon_0$ | Permittivity of free space |

### Implications of the Equations

* In the **absence of piezoelectricity** ($E = 0$), Eq 3 reduces to **Hooke's law**.
* If $S = 0$, Eq 3 presents the **converse piezoelectric effect**.
* If $S = 0$, Eq 4 shows the standard dielectric relation.
* If $E = 0$, strain alone can induce polarisation as per Eq 4 (The **direct piezoelectric effect**).

### Sensor Characteristics and Applications

* **Passive Sensor:** Since this sensor generates its own voltage, it **does not require power for operation**. Therefore, piezoelectric devices can be used for applications where **power consumption is a significant constraint**.
* **Limitation:** Piezoelectric sensing is sensitive only to **time-varying signals** and hence **static quantities such as weight cannot be measured** by using this approach.
* **Applications:** Piezoelectric sensing is widely used in **pressure and force sensors, accelerometers, hydrophones, microphones**, etc.
