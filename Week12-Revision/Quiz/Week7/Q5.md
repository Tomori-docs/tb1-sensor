Write down two differences between electrostriction and
piezoelectricity phenomenon in electrostrictive and piezoelectric
actuators. * 

Answer:
• The piezoelectric material has a spontaneous polarization PS due to the asymmetric
crystal structure. Under the action of a polarization electric field Epol, PS reorientates
toward the Epol. After the polarization electric field is removed, the material still retains
a polarization Pr
. Under the excitation of an external AC electric field, the material will
extend and contract alternately, yielding positive and negative strains.
• The polarization in electrostrictive materials is field induced. Electrostriction is a
measure of the polarization induced by ions shifting away from their natural
equilibrium positions. In centrosymmetric crystals, the induced shifts of equivalent
ions almost cancel each other out, while the difference in the shifts because of
applied field generates strain (i.e., the extension of the lattice).
• The relationship between the force produced and applied field is linear in
piezoelectrics, it is quadratic in electrostrictive materials.
