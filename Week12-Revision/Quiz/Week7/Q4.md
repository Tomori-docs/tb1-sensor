An electrodynamic actuator is designed by placing an N-turn coil on a
rotational pole inside the magnetic field of a permanent magnet.
Write down the equation for the applied force onto the coil and
describe the reason for the pole rotation. * 


答案：
• The permanent magnet create radial induction B across the air-gap. A light coil (N
turns) sits in that gap on a rotational pole. When current i passes through the coil,
each active conductor segment with length dl in the gap experiences a Lorentz force.
The two opposite sides of the coil feel equal and opposite forces, producing a torque
that results in the pole rotation.
• The magnetic force is given by Laplace’s force law:$d\vec{F}_{\text{mag}} = i d\vec{l} \times \vec{B}$
