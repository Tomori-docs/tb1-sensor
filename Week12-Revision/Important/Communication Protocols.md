• Communication protocols: UART, SPI, I2C, CAN, USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and
Bluetooth.

• Serial communication could be simplex, half duplex, or full duplex.

• In asynchronous data transfer, the transmitter and receiver do not share a
common clock signal, whereas, in synchronous transfer, there is a common clock signal between the transmitter and receiver.
