• Various concepts can be used for modelling a sensor/actuator: Analytical,
numerical, statistical and data-driven, transfer function/state-space,
stochastic/probabilistic, empirical/curve-fitting, and multiphysics and coupled
models.
• Semiconductors, metals, ceramics, and polymers can be used for fabricating
sensor/actuators.
• Fabrication of micro/nano-devices could be done by using top-down or
bottom-up approaches and includes several steps of spin coating, patterning
(photolithography, lift-off, polymer printing methods), etching, and deposition.
