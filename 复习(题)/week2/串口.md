2. Serial communication could be simplex, half duplex, or full duplex:
Serial channels are classified in terms of their direction of transfer as simplex,
half duplex, or full duplex:

---
1. Simplex: 
![](/file/2/dnUYHi8SnonMpKVh01UHp.png)

Data transfer data in only one direction.
e.g., the ring network (a
type of computer network
topology where each
device (node) is
connected to exactly two
other devices, forming a
continuous closed loop or
ring.).

---
Half duplex: 
![](/file/2/4oW1IirnH9gnWZSS0CZ48.png)

Data transfer in
either direction, but in only
one direction at a time. e.g.,
the desktop serial bus, or
multi drop network (a
communication configuration
where multiple devices
(usually three or more) are
connected to a single shared
communication line or bus.)

---

Full duplex: 
![](/file/2/1XwS3ryKTA0eYreFxaq2c.png)

Data transfer in
both directions
simultaneously. e.g.,
telephone call, modern
ethernet network, Wi-Fi
networks, video conferencing
systems.
