SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)：支持全双工通信，但实际应用中经常只使用单向传输以实现“半双工”模式。其主要优点是高速（通常远快于I²C和UART）、协议简单、无寻址开销。它是最常用于微控制器与高速外围设备（如存储器、传感器、显示屏）进行点对点或单主多从通信的协议之一，完全符合题目“高速、半双工”的要求。

I²C：速度较低（标准模式100kbps，快速模式400kbps），虽然支持多主多从，但其半双工特性主要受限于同一时刻总线上只能有一个方向的数据流。

UART：通常用于中低速、异步通信，是全双工协议（有独立的TX和RX线），但其标准速度通常低于SPI。

USB：功能强大且速度可以很高，但协议复杂，通常需要专门的控制器，用于主机与外设的连接，并不符合微控制器与简单外设之间简单、高速通信的典型场景。
因此，对于“高速、半双工”这个需求，SPI是最常见和合适的选择。

1.  Communication protocols: UART, SPI, I2C, CAN, USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and
Bluetooth.

Serial communication protocols between I/O devices and microcontrollers are:
• UART: Asynchronous communication as a full-duplex channel, through two
independent wires, connecting the RX pin of each endpoint to the TX pin on
the opposite side.
• Serial peripheral interface (SPI): Synchronised full-duplex communication
by using a clock line (SCK). The microcontroller share wires with two
peripherals: COPI (Controller out peripheral in) and CIPO (Controller in
peripheral out). The bus uses two separate select signals (CS) for each
peripheral.
• Inter-integrated circuit (I2C): Interconnecting multiple microcontrollers and
peripherals on the same two-wire bus. The two signals are serial clock (SCL)
and serial data (SDA). Unlike, SPI or UART, the bus is half-duplex.
• Controller area networks (CAN): Incudes multiple nodes. Each node
consists of a processor, a controller and a transceiver. CAN uses messages
over a pair of wires to identify each node.

• Universal Serial Bus (USB): Originally designed to replace UART. This
protocol works in host-device mode, with one side of the communication, the
device, exposing services that can be used by the controller, on the host
side.
• Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth: Some microcontrollers embed network
interfaces for wired or wireless communication that enables connection to
local networks or the internet for IoT and cloud applications.

2. Serial communication could be simplex, half duplex, or full duplex:
Serial channels are classified in terms of their direction of transfer as simplex,
half duplex, or full duplex:

---
1. Simplex: 
![](/file/2/dnUYHi8SnonMpKVh01UHp.png)

Data transfer data in only one direction.
e.g., the ring network (a
type of computer network
topology where each
device (node) is
connected to exactly two
other devices, forming a
continuous closed loop or
ring.).

---
Half duplex: 
![](/file/2/4oW1IirnH9gnWZSS0CZ48.png)

Data transfer in
either direction, but in only
one direction at a time. e.g.,
the desktop serial bus, or
multi drop network (a
communication configuration
where multiple devices
(usually three or more) are
connected to a single shared
communication line or bus.)

---

Full duplex: 
![](/file/2/1XwS3ryKTA0eYreFxaq2c.png)

Data transfer in
both directions
simultaneously. e.g.,
telephone call, modern
ethernet network, Wi-Fi
networks, video conferencing
systems.







3. In asynchronous data transfer, the transmitter and receiver do not share a
common clock signal, whereas, in synchronous transfer, there is a common clock signal between the transmitter and receiver:


• A clock signal is needed to synchronize the receiver’s timing to the incoming
serial data so that the receiver can latch each data bit. Serial data transfers
can be classified as either asynchronous or synchronous based on the
nature of the clock signal.
• In asynchronous transfer, the transmitter and receiver do not share a
common clock signal. Each provides its own independent clock. Both clocks
run at the same nominal frequency. Synchronization is established on a
frame-by-frame basis, and only for the duration of each frame. The
advantage of asynchronous transfer is its low cost. It is used primarily where
transmission of frames is irregular, or where large blocks of data do not need
to be transmitted at high speed.
• In synchronous transfer, either a common clock signal exists between the
transmitter and receiver, or the receiver is capable of deriving a clock signal
from the transitions of the received data signal.
