Q12: Calculate the equivalent capacitance for the parallel-plate and interdigitated
(IDT) electrodes capacitors presented in Figure Q12. The gap of both capacitors is
filled with air with the permittivity of . For simplicity, we assume fringe capacitance is
negligible when computing the IDT’s equivalent capacitance. 

答案：
Parallel-plate capacitor:  [(20t.t)/5t] =  4t (3 marks)
Interdigitated capacitor:  [2[(11t.t)/5t] + 3[(4t.t)/5t]] = [ (22/5)t +(12/5) t] = (34/5)t
