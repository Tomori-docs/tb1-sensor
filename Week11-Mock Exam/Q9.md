Q9: Fill the blank […] with the correct words: (2 marks)
[…] is the amount of energy stored per battery’s unit mass and is measured in watthours per kilogram (Wh/kg).
A. Electrochemical energy density
B. Power density
C. Nominal voltage density
D. None of the above options is correct.

答案：D

答案解析：
▪ This is an example of how you need to know the basic
concepts/definitions, in this case battery characteristics
▪ The definition corresponds to gravimetric energy density
(or specific energy), which is defined as the amount of
energy stored per battery’s unit mass. Measured in
watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg), so the solution is D.
▪ Always ensure that statements, definitions, and
nomenclature correspond to the official terminology
▪ To ensure that a statement or definition is right, ALL the
elements in the definition must be right. For instance,
the statement:
– Gravimetric energy density is defined as the
amount of energy stored per battery’s unit mass
and is measured in Watts per kilogram (W/kg)
▪ is wrong, as the second part is wrong (Gravimetric
energy density is measured in watt-hours per kilogram
(Wh/kg)
