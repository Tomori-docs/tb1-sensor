Q7: The actuator consists of a slab of piezoelectric material with length (l), width (b),
and thickness (h). An AC electric field is applied across the thickness of the slab.
Identify the correct statement for the resonating behaviour of the slab: (2 marks)
A. If (l and b) ≫ h, the slab will vibrate in the thickness direction.
B. If (l and b) ≫ h, the slab will vibrate along the length direction.
C. If l ≫ (b and h), the slab will vibrate along the thickness direction.
D. None of the above statements is correct.
