答案：
(a) The applied E will polarize the electrostrictive material that means ions will shift
away from their natural equilibrium positions. This shift generates strain (i.e., the
extension of the lattice). Both E>0 and E<0 would induce the expansion of the
electrostrive layer across thickness. (5 marks)
(b) The transformer shows the conversion of electrical to mechanical energy. C1 is the
static capacitance formed between two electrodes. CM, RM, and LM are the equivalent
mechanical components for the actuator where CM is the motional capacitance
(Representing stiffness), RM is the motional resistance (Representing damping), and
LM is the motional inductance (Representing Effective mass). (3 marks each
component)
(c) For the same applied E, the generated displacement in a piezoelectric actuator is
proportional to E while for the electrostrictive actuator, is proportional to E2
. (5 marks)
