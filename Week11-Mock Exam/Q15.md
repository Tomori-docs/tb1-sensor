Q15:
(a) Define what is a battery, identifying its main components and explaining its principle
of operation based on Figure Q15. (15 marks)
(b) Describe how batteries can be classified, providing examples of each type.
 (5 marks)
(c) Describe the main limitations of battery-operated devices. (5 marks)


答案：
(a) A battery is a device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy and vice
versa (if rechargeable). (5 marks)
The figure shows a (rechargeable) Lithium–Ion battery, which is comprised by a
cathode composed of lithium metal oxide, an anode made from graphite, and an
electrolyte that contains lithium ions, as shown (drawn) below. (5 marks)
During the discharging operation, the lithium ions move from the anode to the cathode
through the electrolyte, while electrons flow through the external circuit, providing
power to the device. During the charging operation these reactions reverse. (5 marks)

(b) Batteries can be classified as Primary (Non-rechargeable) and Secondary
(Rechargeable). Examples include:
• Non-rechargeable: Alkaline Batteries, Zinc–Air Batteries.

• Rechargeable: Lithium–Ion (Li–Ion) Batteries, Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCO)
Batteries, Lithium Manganese Oxide (LMO), Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt
Oxide, Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) Batteries, Lithium–Polymer (LiPo)
Batteries, Redox Flow Batteries, Solid-State Batteries, Lead-Acid Batteries,
Nickel–Metal Hydride (NiMH).
(c) Some limitations of batteries and battery-operated systems include:
• Leakage and/or self-discharge can lead to battery depletion even during
periods of inactivity.
• Environmental constraints: Battery performance degrades in harsh conditions,
causing capacity and power losses.
• Size & weight trade-off: Larger and heavier batteries are required to increase
capacity.
• Environmental impact: Hazardous chemicals make batteries difficult to recycle
and dispose of safely.



解析：
- a
  1. identifying its main components: The figure shows a
(rechargeable) Lithium–Ion battery, which is comprised
by a cathode composed of lithium metal oxide, an
anode made from graphite, and an electrolyte that
contains lithium ions, as shown below
  2.  explaining its principle of operation: During the
discharging operation, the lithium ions move from the
anode to the cathode through the electrolyte, while
electrons flow through the external circuit, providing
power to the device. During the charging operation
these reactions reverse

- b
  Batteries can be classified as Primary (nonrechargeable) and Secondary (Rechargeable).
Examples include:
▪ Non-rechargeable: Alkaline Batteries, Zinc–Air Batteries
▪ Rechargeable: Lithium–Ion (Li–Ion) Batteries, Lithium
Cobalt Oxide (LCO) Batteries, Lithium Manganese
Oxide (LMO), Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide,
Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) Batteries, Lithium–
Polymer (LiPo) Batteries, Redox Flow Batteries, SolidState Batteries, Lead-Acid Batteries, Nickel–Metal
Hydride (NiMH)

- c
  Some limitations of batteries and battery-operated
systems include:
– Leakage and/or self-discharge can lead to battery
depletion even during periods of inactivity
– Environmental constraints: Battery performance
degrades in harsh conditions, causing capacity and
power losses
– Size & weight trade-off: Larger and heavier
batteries are required to increase capacity
– Environmental impact: Hazardous chemicals make
batteries difficult to recycle and dispose of safely
