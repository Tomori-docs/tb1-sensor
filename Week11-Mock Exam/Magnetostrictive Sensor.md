答案：
① The current pulse is applied to one end of the magnetostrictive wire. The time base
waveform denotes the rising edge at each cycle of the current pulse waveform.
② Circular magnetic field is generated around the wire and travels across the wire.
③ Magnetic field from the position magnet and the circular magnetic field interact and
④ produces a strain pulse.
⑤ Travel time of the strain pulse to the pick-up circuit is proportional to the distance
the pulse travels, in other words defines the position of the movable magnet.
⑥ The travel time can be measured multiple times for accurate prediction of the
movable magnet position.

知识点：
• How a magnetostrictive sensor can be used
as a position/displacement sensor?
• How the travel time waveform can show the
position?
