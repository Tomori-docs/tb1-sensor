• The process to form a thin (0.1 – 50 µm) conformal layer of an organic solution on a
substrate. E.g., coating PI on a Si wafer.
• The solution is poured on the substrate (a), and the sample is rotated in a high speed
– typically over 10 rotations per second. The centrifugal forces spread the material (b)
and the excess is flung off the sides. Airflow dries most of the solvent (c) and after the
solvent evaporates, a thin layer of film remains on the sample (d). The spin coating is
usually followed by a step of baking to turn the layer into a solid layer.
