• The process to form a thin/thick crystalline layer on a substrate. E.g., a layer of
Ga0.47In0.53As on the InP substrate or silicon dioxide (SiO2
) on a Si substrate..
• The substrates or wafers are positioned on a stationary or rotating table (the substrate
holder) whose temperature is elevated up to the required level by the heating
elements. The top cover of the chamber has an inlet for the carrier H2 gas, which can
be added by various precursors and dopants. These additives, while being carried
over the heated surface of the substrate, form a film layer. The gas mixture flows from
the distribution cone over the top surface of the wafers and exits through the exhaust
gas outlets. This is accompanied by the production of chemical by-products that are
exhausted out of the chamber along with unreacted precursor gases.
