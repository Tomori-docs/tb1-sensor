• Wet etching: The removal of material by immersing the wafer in a liquid bath of the
chemical etchant. Wet etchants fall into two broad categories; isotropic etchants and
anisotropic etchants. Isotropic etchants attack the material being etched at the same
rate in all directions (e.g., hydrofluoric acid (HF) for etching SiO2
). Anisotropic etchants
attack the silicon wafer at different rates in different directions, and so there is more
control of the shapes produced (e.g. potassium hydroxide (KOH)).
• Dry etching: The most common form of dry etching is reactive ion etching (RIE). Ions
are accelerated towards the material to be etched, and the etching reaction is
enhanced in the direction of travel of the ion, thus RIE is an anisotropic etching
technique. Deep trenches and pits (up to ten or a few tens of microns) of arbitrary
shape and with vertical walls can be etched in a variety of materials including silicon,
oxide and nitride. RIE can also be used for etching polymers.
