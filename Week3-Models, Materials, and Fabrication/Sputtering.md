• The process to form a thin conformal layer of a metal on a substrate. E.g., coating Al
on a Si wafer.
• As in the vacuum deposition method, sputtering is performed in a vacuum chamber;
however, after evacuation of air, an inert gas, such as argon or helium, is introduced
into the chamber at about 2×10-6–5×10-6 Torr. An external high voltage DC or AC
power supply is attached to the cathode (target) which is fabricated of the target metal.
The substrate is attached to the anode at some distance from the cathode. High
voltage ignite plasma of the inert gas, and the gas ions bombard the target. The
kinetic energy of the bombarding ions free some atoms from the target surface.
Hence, the escaped sputtered atoms deposit on the surface of the sample.
