• Ink-jet printing: The printer, includes a cartridge with ink, a printhead, and a control
system for the position of the printhead. Usually, small droplets, normally at a volume
of several pico-liters, are jetted from the printhead based on various mechanismsby
using electric and thermal actuators.
• Screen printing: The ink is pressed through a stencil to print the pattern on the
substrate. The blade moves along the surface and removes the ink residuals.
• Nano-Imprinting Lithography (NIL): A mold (stamp) with nanoscale patterns is
fabricated (usually from silicon, quartz, or metal). A thin polymer film (resist) is coated
on the substrate. The mold is pressed into the resist under controlled pressure and
sometimes heat or UV light. The resist solidifies, and when the mold is removed, the
pattern is transferred to the substrate.
