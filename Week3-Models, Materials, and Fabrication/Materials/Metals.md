• There are two classes of metals: Nonferrous and ferrous.
➢ Ferrous metals, like steel, are often used in combination with magnetic
sensors to measure motion, distance, magnetic field strength, etc. They
are also used as magnetic shields.
➢ Nonferrous metals, on the other hand, are permeable to magnetic fields
and used whenever these fields are of no concern.
• When selecting a metal, one must consider not only its physical properties
but also ease of mechanical processing.

Below are the list of some common nonferrous metals:
• Copper (Cu): Has excellent thermal and electrical properties, yet it is difficult to
machine, so in many instances aluminium should be considered as a compromise
alternative, especially where soldering is not required.
• Aluminium (Al): Has a high strength-to-weight ratio and possesses its own
anticorrosion mechanism. When exposed to air, aluminium does not oxide
progressively, like iron would do.
• Gold (Au): Extremely soft and chemically inert metal. In sensor applications, gold is
used for fabricating electrical contacts and plating mirrors and waveguides that
operate in the mid- and far-infrared spectral ranges.
• Silver (Ag): Least costly of all precious metals. It is very malleable and corrosion
resistant. It has the highest electrical and thermal conductivity of all metals.
• Platinum (Pt): Extremely malleable, ductile and corrosion resistant. Its positive
temperature coefficient of resistance is very stable and reproducible which allows its
use in temperature sensing.
