• Plastics: Synthetic materials made from chemical raw materials called monomers,
e.g., a monomer (one chemical unit) such as ethylene is reacted with other monomer
molecules to form long chains of repeating ethylene units, forming the polymer
polyethylene.
➢ The polymers consist of carbon atoms in combination with other elements such as
hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O) fluorine (F), silicon (Si), sulfur (S), and
chlorine (Cl).
➢ If two different monomers (A and B) are combined in a polymerization reaction,
such a polymer is called copolymer. Final properties of copolymer depend on ratio
of components A and B.
• Thermoplastic: A plastic polymer material that becomes soft and moldable when
heated and hardens again when cooled without undergoing any chemical change in
its structure.
• Thermoset polymer: A type of polymer material that undergoes a permanent
chemical curing process, forming strong cross-linked bonds between polymer chains.
This curing makes the material irreversibly hard and rigid.

Below are the list of some common thermoplastics:
• Fluoroplastics such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) comprise a large family of
materials: Excellent electrical properties and chemical resistance, low friction and
outstanding stability at high temperatures.
• Polyethylene: Lightweight, inexpensive with excellent chemical stability and good
electrical properties.
• Polyvinyl chloride (PVC): Third most widely used thermoplastic polymer after
polyethylene and polypropylene.
• Epoxy: Exceptional mechanical strength, electrical properties and adhesion to most
of materials.
• Conductive plastics: By mixing plastics with conductive additives (for instance,
graphite or metal fibers) or building composite plastic parts incorporating metal mesh.
• Piezoelectric plastics: Made from PVF2
, PVDF and copolymers which are crystalline
materials.
• Polyimide (PI)/Kapton: A thermoset material stable in a wide range of temperatures.
It is used in flexible printed circuits and as substrate for flexible sensors.
