• Ceramics: Crystalline materials with high structural strength, thermal stability, light
weight, resistance to many chemicals, ability to bond with other materials, and
excellent electrical properties.
• Although most metals form at least one chemical compound with oxygen, only a
handful of oxides are useful as the principal constituent of ceramics. Examples are
alumina and beryllia.
• Several metal carbides and nitrides qualify as ceramics. Most used are boron carbide
(B4C), silicon nitride (SiC), and aluminium nitride (AlN).
• AlN has fast heat transfer, while SiC has high dielectric constant, suitable for
designing capacitive sensors.
• Ceramics for the sensor substrates are available from many manufacturers in
thickness ranging from 0.1 to 10 mm.
• Functional ceramics are advanced ceramic materials engineered to possess specific
electrical (e.g., lead zirconate titanate (PZT)), magnetic, optical, thermal, or biological
properties beyond the traditional structural roles of ceramics.
