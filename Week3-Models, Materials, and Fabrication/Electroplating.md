• Deposition of a metal coating on an electrically conductive object by using electric
current. E.g., Au on a PI substrate.
• The process used in electroplating is called electrodeposition. The part to be coated
is placed into a bath or tank containing a solution of one or more metal salts. The part
that requires plating is connected to an electrical circuit, forming the cathode
(negative) of the circuit while an electrode (typically of the same metal to be plated)
forms the anode—a positive electrode. The anode and cathode in the electroplating
cell are connected to a DC power supply. The metal of the anode is oxidized to form
cations with a positive charge. These cations associate with the anions in the
solution. The cations are reduced at the cathode to deposit in the metallic state.
