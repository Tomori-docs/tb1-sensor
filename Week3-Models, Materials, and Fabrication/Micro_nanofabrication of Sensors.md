### Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS)

* **MEMS** (micro-electromechanical systems), as a subgroup of sensors and actuators, is the technology of microscopic devices incorporating both electronic and moving parts.
* MEMS fabrication is a specialized, high-precision subset that comes from microelectronics, ideal for making reproducible, batch-manufactured devices (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes, pressure sensors).
