## 📸 Photolithography

* **Patterning micro/nano-structures on a substrate.** E.g., micro-scale patterns of a photoresist on a Si wafer. Usually, the patterned photoresist layer is used for patterning of another layer (e.g., $\text{SiO}_2$) underneath through etching.
* The process begins with producing a **mask** (i.e., a chromium pattern on a glass plate). The wafer is then coated with a polymer (**photoresist**) which is sensitive to ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light is then shone through the mask onto the photoresist. The photoresist is then developed which transfers the pattern on the mask to the photoresist layer.
* There are two types of photoresist, **positive** and **negative**.
    * Where the ultraviolet light strikes the **positive resist** it weakens the polymer, so that when the image is developed the resist is washed away where the light struck it.
    * The opposite occurs with the **negative resist**.
* A chemical (or some other method) is then used to remove $\text{SiO}_2$ where it is exposed through the openings in the resist. Finally, the resist is removed by using a solution leaving the patterned $\text{SiO}_2$.
