• The process to form a thin conformal layer of a metal on a substrate. E.g., coating Al
on a Si wafer.
• The system consists of a vacuum chamber where diffuse pump evacuates air down to
10-6–10-7 Torr of pressure. A target metal is placed into a ceramic crucible which is
heated by tungsten filament above the metal melting point and converted into gaseous
form and then deposited on the surface of the substrate. An alternative method of
heating is use of an electron beam.
