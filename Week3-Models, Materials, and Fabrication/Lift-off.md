• Lift-off is a stencilling technique often used to pattern metal films.
• A layer of photoresist is coated on a Si substrate and patterned using
photolithography. A thin layer of metal is deposited on top. A photoresist remover
solution is used to remove the photoresist and the metal layer above it and leave the
remaining metal layer.
