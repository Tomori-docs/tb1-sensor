There are two fundamental approaches for fabricating nanoscale devices:
• Top-Down fabrication: Starting from a bulk material, top-down methods create smaller
features by removing or shaping material. Uses techniques like photolithography,
electron beam lithography, and etching (chemical or plasma). High precision, welldefined, but requires specialised and expensive equipment.
• Bottom-up fabrication: Building structures by assembling atoms, molecules, or
nanoparticles step-by-step, essentially growing nanostructures from the smallest
building blocks. Uses chemical synthesis, molecular self-assembly, chemical vapor
deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD). Challenges in precise positioning
and patterning over large areas.
