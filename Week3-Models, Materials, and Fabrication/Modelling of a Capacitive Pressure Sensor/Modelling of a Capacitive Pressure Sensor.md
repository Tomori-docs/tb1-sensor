• The pressure sensor consists of:
➢ Top part: a thin dielectric on a flat bottom electrode.
➢ Bottom part: A thin electrode layer coated on a deformable
micro-pyramids.
• The top part applies pressure on the bottom part that increases
the contact area between the micro-pyramids and the supporting
substrate, yielding an increasing of the overall capacitance

• The top part applies pressure on the bottom part that increases
the contact area between the micro-pyramids and the supporting
substrate, yielding an increasing of the overall capacitance.

• To obtain the analytical solution of mechanics for the
micro-pyramidal pressure sensors, first the
axisymmetric micro-conical structure was used and
then extended to the micro-pyramidal counterpart.

• Due to the symmetry of the micro-cones and to reduce
the complexity, the 3D geometry is changed into a 2D
planar geometry (i.e., the method of dimensionality
reduction (MDR) based on half-space approximation).
