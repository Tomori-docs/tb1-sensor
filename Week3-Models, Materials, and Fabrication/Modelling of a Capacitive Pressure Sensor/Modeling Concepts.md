• Analytical/equation-based models: Using fundamental physical laws to
derive equations that describe device behaviour.
• Numerical methods:
➢ Finite Element Method (FEM): For simulating the behaviour of complex
structures. It requires dividing the system into small elements (known as
meshing) and solves the governing equations numerically. (e.g., stress
analysis in a pressure sensor, L3- slide 9)
➢ Finite Difference Method (FDM): For time-dependent or distributed
systems by dividing the domain into overlapping subdomains and
approximating derivatives with finite differences. This converts differential
equations into algebraic equations that can be solved numerically. (e.g.,
modelling heat transfer in a temperature sensor)

• Statistical and data-driven models: Employ statistical methods or machine
learning to model device characteristics based on empirical data. (e.g., L3-
slide 13).
• Transfer function/state-space models: Provide a mathematical
representation for the dynamic behaviour of a system (input–output
relationship). (e.g., an equivalent circuit of an actuator covered in L4)
• Stochastic/probabilistic models: Used when input or device behaviour is
inherently random or subject to noise. (e.g. gas sensors)
• Empirical/curve-fitting models: Use fitting techniques
(linear, polynomial) to match observed device data with
mathematical expressions. (e.g., pressure sensors)
• Multiphysics and coupled models: Integrate models across
multiple domains to capture complex behaviour in devices.
(e.g., electro-mechanical in L3- slide 9)
